BUSINE\\nSS\\nGe\\nneral\\nWalmart Inc. (\"Walmart,\" the \"Company\" or \"we\") is a people-led, technology-powered omni-channel retailer dedicated to help \\npeople around the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in both \\nretail stores and through eCommerce, and to access our other service offerings.  Through innovation, we strive to continuously \\nimprove a customer-centric experience that seamlessly integrates our eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering \\nthat saves time for our customers.  Each week, we serve approximately 240 million customers who visit more than 10,500 \\nstores and numerous eCommerce websites in 20 countries.\\nOur strategy is to make every day easier for busy families, operate with discipline, sharpen our culture and become more digital, \\nand make trust a competitive advantage.  Making life easier for busy families includes our commitment to price leadership, \\nwhich has been and will remain a cornerstone of our business, as well as increasing convenience to save our customers time.  \\nBy leading on price, we earn the trust of our customers every day by providing a broad assortment of quality merchandise and \\nservices at everyday low prices (\"EDLP\").  EDLP is our pricing philosophy under which we price items at a low price every \\nday so our customers trust that our prices will not change under frequent promotional activity.  Everyday low cost (\"EDLC\") is \\nour commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our customers.\\nOur operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam\\'s Club.  Our fiscal year ends \\non January 31 for our United States (\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations.  We consolidate all other operations generally using a \\none-month lag and on a calendar year basis.  Our discussion is as of and for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 (\"fiscal \\n2023\"), January 31, 2022 (\"fiscal 2022\") and January 31, 2021 (\"fiscal 2021\").  During fiscal 2023, we generated total revenues \\nof $611.3 billion, which was comprised primarily of net sales of $605.9 billion.\\nWe maintain our principal offices in Bentonville, Arkansas.  Our common stock trades on the New York Stock Exchange under \\nthe symbol \"WMT.\"\\nThe Development of Our Company\\nThe businesses conducted by our founders began in 1945 when Sam M. Walton opened a franchise Ben Franklin variety store \\nin Newport, Arkansas.  In 1946, his brother, James L. Walton, opened a similar store in Versailles, Missouri.  Until 1962, our \\nfounders\\' business was devoted entirely to the operation of variety stores. In 1983, we opened our first Sam\\'s Club, and in 1988, \\nwe opened our first supercenter.  In 1998, we opened our first Walmart Neighborhood Market.  In 1991, we began our first \\ninternational initiative when we entered into a joint venture in Mexico and, as of January 31, 2023, our Walmart International \\nsegment conducted business in 19 countries.\\nIn 2000, we began our first eCommerce initiative by creating both walmart.com and samsclub.com.  Since then, our \\neCommerce presence has continued to grow.  In 2007, leveraging our physical stores, walmart.com launched its Site to Store \\nservice, enabling customers to make a purchase online and pick up merchandise in stores.  To date, we now have over 8,100 \\npickup and approximately 7,000 delivery locations globally.  In recent years, we have heavily invested in omni-channel and \\neCommerce innovation, which has enabled us to leverage technology, talent and expertise, incubate digitally-native brands, and \\nexpand our assortment and service offerings. We have also continued to enhance our eCommerce initiatives, such as with our \\nacquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart Private Limited (\"Flipkart\"), which is our ecosystem in India that includes \\neCommerce platforms of Flipkart and Myntra, as well as with our majority stake in PhonePe Private Limited (\"PhonePe\"), a \\ndigital transaction platform.\\nWe are enhancing our ecosystem with our omni-channel capabilities, stores, service offerings, eCommerce websites and \\nmarketplaces as well as our supply chain combined with approximately 2.1 million associates as of January 31, 2023 to better \\nserve our customers.  Together, we believe these elements produce a flywheel effect which creates relationships where \\ncustomers view Walmart as their primary destination.  In the U.S., our Walmart+ membership incorporates several service \\nofferings which provide enhanced omni-channel shopping experiences and benefits for members.  As we execute on our \\nstrategy globally, our flywheel is accelerating through offerings such as our Walmart Connect advertising business, Walmart \\nFulfillment Services, providing access to quality, affordable healthcare via Walmart Health and Flipkart Health+, and our \\nfinancial services businesses.  These offerings represent mutually reinforcing pieces of our flywheel centered around our \\ncustomers around the world who are increasingly seeking convenience.\\n6', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 7}), Document(page_content='Infor\\nmation About Our Segments\\nWe are engaged in global operations of retail, wholesale and other units, as well as eCommerce, located throughout the U.S., \\nAfrica, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico.  We also previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of \\nWalmart Argentina in fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first \\nquarter of fiscal 2022.  Refer to Note 12  t\\no our Consolidated Financial Statements for information on these divestitures.  Our \\noperations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam\\'s Club, which are further \\ndescribed below.  Each segment contributes to the Company\\'s operating results differently.  However, each has generally \\nmaintained a consistent contribution rate to the Company\\'s net sales in recent years other than minor changes to the contribution \\nrate for the Walmart International segment due to the exit of certain markets and fluctuations in currency exchange rates.  \\nAdditional information on our operating segments and geographic information is contained in Note 13  t\\no our Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements. \\nWalmart U.S. Segment\\nWalmart U.S. is our largest segment and operates in the U.S., including in all 50 states, Washington D.C. and Puerto Rico. \\nWalmart U.S. is a mass merchandiser of consumer products, operating under the \"Walmart\" and \"Walmart Neighborhood \\nMarket\" brands, as well as walmart.com and other eCommerce brands.  Walmart U.S. had net sales of $420.6 billion for fiscal \\n2023, representing 69% of our fiscal 2023 consolidated net sales, and had net sales of $393.2 billion and $370.0 billion for \\nfiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.  Of our three segments, Walmart U.S. has historically had the highest gross profit as a \\npercentage of net sales (\"gross profit rate\").  In addition, Walmart U.S. has historically contributed the greatest amount to the \\nCompany\\'s net sales and operating income. \\nOmni-channel.  W\\nalmart U.S. provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and eCommerce, \\nthrough services such as pickup and delivery, in-home delivery, ship-from-store, and digital pharmacy fulfillment options.  As \\nof January 31, 2023, we had more tha n 4,600 pi\\nckup locations and more than 3,900 sa\\nme-day delivery locations.  Our \\nWalmart+ membership offering provides enhanced omni-channel shopping benefits including unlimited free shipping on \\neligible items with no order minimum, unlimited delivery from store, fuel discounts, access to Paramount+ streaming service, \\nand mobile scan & go for a streamlined in-store shopping experience.  We have several eCommerce websites, the largest of \\nwhich is walmart.com.  We define eCommerce sales as sales initiated by customers digitally and fulfilled by a number of \\nmethods including our dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers and leveraging our stores, as well as certain other business \\nofferings that are part of our flywheel strategy, such as our Walmart Connect advertising business.

Wa\\nlmart U.S. does business primarily in three strategic merchandise units, listed below:\\n• Grocery consists of a full line of grocery items, including dry grocery, snacks, dairy, meat, produce, deli & bakery, \\nfrozen foods, alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages, as well as consumables such as health and beauty aids, pet \\nsupplies, household chemicals, paper goods and baby products;\\n• General merchandise includes:\\n◦Entertainment (e.g., electronics, toys, seasonal merchandise, wireless, video games, movies, music and \\nbooks);\\n◦Hardlines (e.g., automotive, hardware and paint, sporting goods, outdoor living and stationery);\\n◦ Apparel (e.g., apparel for men, women, girls, boys and infants, as well as shoes, jewelry and accessories); and\\n◦ Home (e.g., housewares and small appliances, bed & bath, furniture and home organization, home \\nfurnishings, home decor, fabrics and crafts).\\n• Health and wellness includes pharmacy, over-the-counter drugs and other medical products, optical services and other \\nclinical services.\\nOther categories in the Walmart U.S. business include an in-house advertising offering via Walmart Connect, supply chain and \\nfulfillment capabilities to online marketplace sellers via Walmart Fulfillment Services, and newer initiatives such as B2B last \\nmile delivery services via Walmart GoLocal, and a suite of data products for merchants and suppliers via Walmart Luminate.  \\nAdditional service offerings include fuel, financial services and related products (including through our digital channels, stores \\nand our fintech venture, ONE), such as money orders, prepaid access, money transfers, check cashing, bill payment, and certain \\ntypes of installment lending.  \\n7', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='Bra\\nnd name merchandise represents a significant portion of the merchandise sold in Walmart U.S.  We also market lines of \\nmerchandise under our private brands, including brands such as: \"Allswell,\" \"Athletic Works,\" \"Eloquii Elements,\" \"Equate,\" \\n\"Free Assembly,\" \"Freshness Guaranteed,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday Time,\" \"Hyper Tough,\" \"Mainstays,\" \\n\"Marketside,\" \"No Boundaries,\" \"onn.,\" \"Ozark Trail,\" \"Parent\\'s Choice,\" \"Sam\\'s Choice,\" \"Scoop,\" \"Spring Valley,\" \"Time \\nand Tru,\" \"Way to Celebrate\" and \"Wonder Nation.\"  The Company also markets lines of merchandise under licensed brands, \\nsome of which include: \"Avia,\" \"Love & Sports,\" \"Better Homes & Gardens,\" \"Pioneer Woman\" and \"Sofia Jeans by Sofia \\nVergara.\"\\nPeriodically, revisions are made to the categorization of the components comprising our strategic merchandise units.  When \\nrevisions are made, the previous periods\\' presentation is adjusted to maintain comparability.\\nOperations.   W\\nalmart U.S. is available to customers through supercenters, discount stores and neighborhood markets, as well \\nas online or through the mobile application 24 hours a day.  Consistent with its strategy, Walmart U.S. continues to develop \\ntechnology tools and services to better serve customers and help stores operate more efficiently, such as pickup and delivery, \\nWalmart+, ship-from-store and other initiatives which provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences. \\nSeasonal Aspects of Operations.  W\\nalmart U.S.\\'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national \\nand religious holidays, as well as different weather patterns.  Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal \\nquarter ending January 31.  \\nCompetition.  W\\nalmart U.S. competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel retailers operating discount, \\ndepartment, retail and wholesale grocers, drug, dollar, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and \\nsupercenter-type stores, social commerce platforms, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment \\nand delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services. Each of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly \\nevolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-funded competitors continue to intensify this competition.  Some \\nof our competitors have longer histories in these lines of business, more customers, and greater brand recognition.  They may be \\nable to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and business partners and to devote greater resources to the development of \\nthese businesses.  In addition, for eCommerce and other internet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better \\nable to innovate and compete with us.\\nOur ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel experience largely \\ndetermines our competitive position within the retail industry.  We compete in a variety of ways, including the prices at which \\nwe sell our merchandise, merchandise and selection availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store \\namenities, the shopping convenience and overall shopping experience we offer, the attractiveness and ease of use of our digital \\nplatforms, cost and speed of and options for delivery to customers of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or \\nthrough our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations.  We employ many strategies and programs \\ndesigned to meet competitive pressures within our industry.  These strategies include the following:\\n• EDLP: our pricing philosophy under which we price items at everyday low prices so our customers trust that our \\nprices will not change under frequent promotional activity;\\n• EDLC: everyday low cost is our commitment to control expenses so our cost savings can be passed along to our \\ncustomers;\\n• Omni-channel offerings such as pickup and delivery and our Walmart+ membership offering, all of which enhance \\nconvenience and seek to serve customers in the ways they want to be served; and \\n• Expanding our flywheel and the products and services we offer in areas such as digital advertising, fulfillment \\nservices, health and wellness, and financial services to provide our customers a broader set of offerings to meet \\nexpanding needs.\\nDistribution . We\\n continue to invest in supply chain automation and utilize a total of 163 distribution facilities which are \\nlocated strategically throughout the U.S.  For fiscal 2023, the majority of Walmart U.S.\\'s purchases of store merchandise were \\nshipped through these facilities, while most of the remaining store merchandise we purchased was shipped directly from \\nsuppliers.  General merchandise and dry grocery merchandise is transported primarily through the segment\\'s private truck fleet; \\nhowever, we contract with common carriers to transport the majority of our perishable grocery merchandise.  We ship \\nmerchandise purchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including \\nfrom our 34 dedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, as well as leveraging our ability to ship or deliver directly from more \\nthan 3,900 st\\nores.\\n8', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 9}), Document(page_content='Wal\\nmart International Segment\\nWalmart International is our second largest segment and operated in 19 countries outside of the U.S. as of January 31, 2023.  \\nWalmart International operates through our wholly-owned subsidiaries in Canada, Chile, China, and Africa (which includes \\nBotswana, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, and Zambia), and our majority-owned \\nsubsidiaries in India, as well as Mexico and Central America (which includes Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras \\nand Nicaragua). Walmart International previously operated in Argentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in fiscal 2021 \\nand operated in the United Kingdom and Japan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.  Refer to \\nNote 12  t\\no our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of recent divestitures.\\nWalmart International includes numerous formats divided into two major categories: retail and wholesale.  These categories \\nconsist of many formats, including: supercenters, supermarkets, hypermarkets, warehouse clubs (including Sam\\'s Clubs) and \\ncash & carry, as well as eCommerce through walmart.com.mx, walmart.ca, flipkart.com, walmart.cn and other sites.  Walmart \\nInternational had net sales of $101.0 billion for fiscal 2023, representing 17% of our fiscal 2023 consolidated net sales, and had \\nnet sales of $101.0 billion and $121.4 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.  The gross profit rate is lower than that of \\nWalmart U.S. primarily because of its format mix. \\nWalmart International\\'s strategy is to create strong local businesses powered by Walmart which means being locally relevant \\nand customer-focused in each of the markets it operates.  We are being deliberate about where and how we choose to operate \\nand continue to re-shape the portfolio to best enable long-term, sustainable and profitable growth.  As such, we have taken \\ncertain strategic actions to strengthen our Walmart International portfolio for the long-term, which include the following \\nhighlights over the last three years: \\n• Divested of Walmart Argentina in November 2020. \\n• Divested of Asda Group Limited (\"Asda\"), our retail operations in the U.K., in February 2021. \\n• Divested of a majority stake in Seiyu, our retail operations in Japan, in March 2021.\\n• Bought out the noncontrolling interest shareholders of our Massmart subsidiary in November 2022 and exited \\noperations in certain countries in Africa in December 2022.\\n• Increased our ownership in PhonePe, our digital transaction platform in India, as part of the separation from Flipkart in \\nDecember 2022.\\nOmni-channel.  W\\nalmart International provides an omni-channel experience to customers, integrating retail stores and \\neCommerce, such as through pickup and delivery services in most of our markets and our marketplaces such as Flipkart in \\nIndia.  Our financial services offerings continue to expand with our digital transaction platform anchored in payments at \\nPhonePe in India.  We have expanded our marketplace in Mexico and Canada, which unlocks fulfillment and advertising \\nservices, and in China, our partnerships with JD.com and JD Daojia continue to drive ecommerce growth.  \\nGenerally, retail units\\' selling areas range in size from 1,400 square feet to 186,000 square feet.  Our wholesale stores\\' selling \\nareas generally range in size from 24,000 square feet to 158,000 square feet.  As of January 31, 2023, Walmart International \\nhad over 2,900 pickup and approximately 2,500 delivery locations.\\nMerchandise.  T\\nhe merchandising strategy for Walmart International is similar to that of our operations in the U.S. in terms of \\nthe breadth and scope of merchandise offered for sale.  While brand name merchandise accounts for a majority of our sales, we \\nhave both leveraged U.S. private brands and developed market specific private brands to serve our customers with high quality, \\nlow priced items.  Along with the private brands we market globally, such as \"Equate,\" \"George,\" \"Great Value,\" \"Holiday \\nTime,\" \"Mainstays,\" \"Marketside\" and \"Parent\\'s Choice,\" our international markets have developed market specific brands \\nincluding \"Aurrera,\" \"Lider,\" and \"PhonePe.\"  In addition, we have developed and continue to grow our relationships with \\nregional and local suppliers in each market to ensure reliable sources of quality merchandise that is equal to national brands at \\nlow prices.\\nConsistent with its strategy, Walmart International continues to build mutually reinforcing businesses in areas such as \\nadvertising, marketplace and fulfillment services, healthcare and financial services.  Our businesses in Mexico and Canada, for \\nexample, offer prepaid cards and money transfers, and our PhonePe business in India continues to grow, providing a platform \\nthat offers mobile and bill payment, person-to-person (P2P) payment, investment and insurance solutions, financial services and \\nadvertising.  In Mexico, we also offer a value-based internet and telephone service allowing customers to enjoy digital \\nconnectivity, and in India we launched Flipkart Health+ enabling us to increase access to affordable care in that country.  \\nCombined, these offerings did not represent a significant portion of annual segment revenues.\\nOperations.  T\\nhe hours of operation for operating units in Walmart International vary by country and by individual markets \\nwithin countries, depending upon local and national ordinances governing hours of operation. Consistent with its strategy, \\nWalmart International continues to develop technology tools and services to better serve customers and help its various formats \\noperate more efficiently, as well as to provide convenient and seamless omni-channel shopping experiences. \\n9', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 10}), Document(page_content=\"Se\\nasonal Aspects of Operations.  W\\nalmart International's business is seasonal to a certain extent.  Historically, its highest sales \\nvolume has occurred in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year.  The seasonality of the business varies by country due to different \\nnational and religious holidays, festivals and customs, as well as different weather patterns.\\nCompetition . W\\nalmart International competes with brick and mortar, eCommerce, and omni-channel retailers who operate \\ndepartment, drug, discount, variety and specialty stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets and supercenter-type stores, wholesale \\nclubs, home-improvement stores, specialty electronics stores, cash & carry operations and convenience stores, and eCommerce \\nretailers, as well as companies that offer services in digital advertising, fulfillment services, health and wellness, and financial \\nservices.  Our ability to develop and operate units at the right locations and to deliver a customer-centric omni-channel \\nexperience largely determines our competitive position within the retail industry.  We believe price leadership is a critical part \\nof our business model and we continue to focus on moving our markets towards an EDLP approach.  Additionally, our ability \\nto operate food departments effectively has a significant impact on our competitive position in the markets where we operate.  \\nEach of these landscapes is highly competitive and rapidly evolving, and new business models and the entry of new, well-\\nfunded competitors continue to intensify this competition.  Some of our competitors have longer histories in these lines of \\nbusiness, more customers, and greater brand recognition.  They may be able to obtain more favorable terms from suppliers and \\nbusiness partners and to devote greater resources to the development of these businesses.  In addition, for eCommerce and other \\ninternet-based businesses, newer or smaller businesses may be better able to innovate and compete with us.\\nDistribution.  W\\ne utilize a total of 188 distribution facilities located in Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India, Mexico \\nand South Africa.  Through these facilities, we process and distribute both imported and domestic products to the operating \\nunits of the Walmart International segment.  During fiscal 2023, the majority of Walmart International's purchases passed \\nthrough these distribution facilities.  Suppliers ship the remainder of Walmart International's purchases directly to our stores in \\nthe various markets in which we operate.  Across the segment, we have efficient networks connecting physical stores and \\ndistribution and fulfillment centers which facilitate the movement of goods to where our customers live.  We ship merchandise \\npurchased by customers on our eCommerce platforms by a number of methods from multiple locations including from our 100 \\ndedicated eCommerce fulfillment centers, more than 3,600 eCommerce sort centers and last-mile delivery facilities in India, as \\nwell as our physical retail stores.\\nSam's Club Segment\\nSam's Club operates in 44 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico.  Sam's Club is a membership-only warehouse club that also \\noperates samsclub.com.  Sam's Club had net sales of $84.3 billion for fiscal 2023, representing 14% of our consolidated fiscal \\n2023 net sales, and had net sales of $73.6 billion and $63.9 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively.  As a membership-\\nonly warehouse club, membership income is a significant component of the segment's operating income.  Sam's Club operates \\nwith a lower gross profit rate and lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales than our other segments.\\nMembership.  T\\nhe following two options are available to members:\\nPlu\\ns Membership Club Membership\\nAnnual Membership Fee $110 $50\\nNumber of Add-on Memberships ($45 each) Up to 16 Up to 8\\nAl\\nl memberships include a spouse/household card at no additional cost.  Plus Members are also eligible for free shipping on the \\nmajority of merchandise, with no minimum order size, and receive discounts on prescriptions and glasses.  Beginning in fiscal \\n2023, Sam's Club launched a single loyalty rewards currency called Sam's Cash which merges and replaces existing Cash \\nRewards for Plus members and Cash Back for Sam's Club Mastercard holders.  Members may redeem Sam's Cash on purchases \\nin the club and online, to pay for membership fees or for cash in clubs.  Sam's Cash does not expire and is available for monthly \\nredemption.  \\nOmni-channel.  Sa\\nm's Club provides an omni-channel experience to members, integrating warehouse clubs and eCommerce \\nthrough such services as Curbside Pickup, mobile Scan & Go, ship-from-club, and delivery-from-club.  Members have access \\nto a broad assortment of merchandise and services, including those not found in our clubs, online at samsclub.com and through \\nour mobile commerce applications.  The warehouse facility sizes generally range between 32,000 and 168,000 square feet, with \\nan average size of approximately 134,000 square feet.  \\nMerchandise.  Sa\\nm's Club offers merchandise in the following five merchandise categories:\\n•Grocery and consumables includes dairy, meat, bakery, deli, produce, dry, chilled or frozen packaged foods, alcoholic \\nand nonalcoholic beverages, floral, snack foods, candy, other grocery items, health and beauty aids, paper goods, \\nlaundry and home care, baby care, pet supplies and other consumable items;\\n• Fuel, tobacco and other categories;\\n10\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 11}), Document(page_content='• H om\\ne and apparel includes home improvement, outdoor living, gardening, furniture, apparel, jewelry, tools and power \\nequipment, housewares, toys, seasonal items, mattresses, and tire and battery centers;\\n• Health and wellness includes pharmacy, optical and hearing services and over-the-counter drugs; and\\n• Technology, office and entertainment includes consumer electronics and accessories, software, video games, office \\nsupplies, appliances, and third-party gift cards.\\nWithin the categories above, the Member\\'s Mark private label brand continues to expand its assortment and deliver member \\nvalue.\\nOperations.  Sa\\nm\\'s Club is available to members through warehouse club locations, as well as online or through the mobile \\napplication 24 hours a day.  Club locations offer Plus Members the ability to shop before regular operating hours.  Consistent \\nwith its strategy, Sam\\'s Club continues to develop technology tools to drive a great member experience.  Curbside Pickup is \\navailable at all clubs to help provide fast, easy and contact-free shopping for members.  Sam\\'s Club also offers \"Scan & Go,\" a \\nmobile checkout and payment solution, which allows members to bypass the checkout line.\\nSeasonal Aspects of Operations.  Sa\\nm\\'s Club\\'s business is seasonal to a certain extent due to calendar events and national and \\nreligious holidays, as well as different weather patterns.  Historically, its highest sales volume has occurred in the fiscal quarter \\nending January 31. \\nCompetition.  Sa\\nm\\'s Club competes with other membership-only warehouse clubs, the largest of which is Costco, as well as \\nwith discount retailers, retail and wholesale grocers, general merchandise wholesalers and distributors, gasoline stations as well \\nas omni-channel and eCommerce retailers and catalog businesses.  At Sam\\'s Club, we provide value at members-only prices, a \\nquality merchandise assortment, and bulk sizing to serve both our Plus and Club members.  Our eCommerce website and \\nmobile commerce applications have increasingly become important factors in our ability to compete.\\nDistribution.  W\\ne utilize 29 dedicated distribution facilities located strategically throughout the U.S., as well as some of the \\nWalmart U.S. segment\\'s distribution facilities which service the Sam\\'s Club segment for certain items.  During fiscal 2023, the \\nmajority of Sam\\'s Club\\'s non-fuel club purchases were shipped from these facilities, while the remainder of our purchases were \\nshipped directly to Sam\\'s Club locations by suppliers.  Sam\\'s Club ships merchandise purchased on samsclub.com and through \\nits mobile commerce applications by a number of methods including shipments made directly from clubs, 13 dedicated \\neCommerce fulfillment centers and other distribution centers.  \\nSam\\'s Club uses a combination of our private truck fleet, as well as common carriers, to transport perishable and non-perishable \\nmerchandise from distribution facilities to clubs.\\nIntellectual Property\\nWe regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary \\ntechnologies, and similar intellectual property as important to our success, and with respect to our associates, customers and \\nothers, we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements to \\nprotect our proprietary rights.  We have registered, or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain \\nnames, trademarks, service marks and copyrights.  Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications \\ncovering certain of our proprietary technology.  We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, \\ncertain of our proprietary rights to third parties.\\n11', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 12}), Document(page_content='Suppl\\niers and Supply Chain\\nAs a retailer and warehouse club operator, we utilize a global supply chain that includes both U.S. and international suppliers \\nfrom whom we purchase the merchandise that we sell in our stores, clubs and online.  In many instances, we purchase \\nmerchandise from producers located near the stores and clubs in which such merchandise will be sold, particularly products in \\nthe \"fresh\" category.  Consistent with applicable laws, we offer our suppliers the opportunity to efficiently sell significant \\nquantities of their products to us. These relationships enable us to obtain pricing that reflects the volume, certainty and cost-\\neffectiveness these arrangements provide to such suppliers, which in turn enables us to provide low prices to our customers.  \\nOur suppliers are subject to standards of conduct, including requirements that they comply with local labor laws, local worker \\nsafety laws and other applicable laws.  Our ability to acquire from our suppliers the assortment and volume of products we wish \\nto offer to our customers, to receive those products within the required time through our supply chain and to distribute those \\nproducts to our stores and clubs, determines, along with other supply chain logistics matters (such as containers or port access \\nfor example), in part, our in-stock levels in our stores and clubs and the attractiveness of our merchandise assortment we offer \\nto our customers and members.\\nGovernment Regulation\\nAs a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which \\nwe operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions.

Risk Factors \" unde\\nr the sub-caption \"Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, \\nReputational and Other Risks.\"\\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") Priorities\\nOur ESG strategy is centered on the concept of creating shared value: we believe we maximize long-term value and create \\ncompetitive advantage for the Company by serving our stakeholders, including our customers, associates, shareholders, \\nsuppliers, business partners, and communities. We believe that addressing such societal needs builds the value of our business, \\nincluding by enhancing customer and associate trust, creating new revenue streams, managing cost and risk, building \\ncapabilities for future advantage, and strengthening the underlying systems on which Walmart and our stakeholders rely. \\nWe prioritize the ESG issues that offer the greatest potential for Walmart to create shared value: issues that rank high in \\nrelevance to our business and stakeholders and which Walmart is positioned to make a positive impact. Our current ESG \\npriorities are categorized into four broad themes: opportunity, sustainability, community, and ethics and integrity.\\n•Opportunity.  Retail can be a powerful engine for inclusive economic opportunity. We aim to advance diversity, \\nequity, and inclusion, and create opportunity for Walmart associates (as further described in the Human Capital \\nManagement section below), our suppliers and workers in supply chains, and the communities in which we operate. \\nDoing so helps us fulfill our customer mission, strengthens our business and helps people build a better life for \\nthemselves and their families.\\n•Sustainability. Walmart\\'s sustainability efforts focus on our ability to create and preserve long-term value for both \\npeople and planet. With respect to people, our sustainability efforts include sourcing responsibly, helping prevent \\nforced labor, empowering women, creating inclusive economic opportunity and selling safer, healthier products. With \\nrespect to the planet, our efforts aim to enhance the sustainability of product supply chains by reducing emissions, \\nprotecting and restoring nature, and reducing waste. To help address the effects of climate change, Walmart has set \\nscience-based targets for emissions reduction, including our goal to achieve zero emissions in our operations by 2040\\n—without offsets—and to reduce or avoid one billion metric tons of emissions in our value chain by 2030 under our \\nProject Gigaton™ initiative. \\n•Community. Walmart aims to serve and strengthen communities by ope\\nrating our business in a way that meets the \\nne\\neds of our customer and community stakeholder groups, including by provi\\nding sa\\nfer, healthier and more affordable \\nfood a\\nnd other products, disaster support, associate volunteerism, local grant programs and community cohesion \\nini\\ntiatives.\\n•Ethics and Integrity. At\\n every level of our Company, we work to create a culture that inspires trust among our \\nassoc\\niates, with our customers, and in the communities we serve. \\nWe\\n periodically publish information on our ESG priorities, strategies, and progress on our corporate website and may update \\nthose\\n disclosures from time to time. Nothing on our website, including our ESG reporting, documents or sections thereof, shall \\nbe\\n deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form\\n 10-K  or i\\nncorporated by reference into any of our other \\nfi\\nlings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\\nHuman Capital Management\\nAt Walmart, we\\'re committed to help people save money and live better around the world. This mission is delivered by our \\nassociates who make the difference for our millions of customers and members every day.  As of the end of fiscal 2023, we \\n12', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 13}), Document(page_content=\"em\\nployed approximately 2.1 million associates worldwide, with approximately 1.6 million associates in the U.S. and \\napproximately 0.5 million associates internationally.  In the U.S., approximately 93% of our associates are hourly and \\napproximately 70% of our associates are full-time. \\nWe know the success and progress we've seen this year and throughout our Company's history is because of our associates who \\nwork every day to fulfill our mission.  That's why we're focused on providing opportunities for associates to grow and learn.  \\nFor some, we are a foundational entry point to develop critical skills that are relevant for a variety of careers, and for others a \\nplace where associates can grow their careers across our global omni-channel business. No matter the role or location, we're \\nfocused on developing, rewarding, and retaining associates in an ever-changing environment. As customer expectations and \\ntechnology change the nature of work, we know it's our people – our humanity – that will differentiate us from the competition, \\nso this must be a top priority.  \\nOur workforce strategy includes the following strategic priorities: belonging, well-being, growth and digital.\\nBelonging  - \\nBuild a Walmart for everyone: a diverse, equitable and inclusive company, where associates' ideas and opinions \\nmatter.  We are focused on having an inclusive culture where everyone feels they belong.  We publish our diversity \\nrepresentation twice yearly, and hold ourselves accountable to providing recurring culture, diversity, equity, and inclusion \\nupdates to senior leadership, including our President and CEO, and members of the Board of Directors.  Of the approximately \\n2.1 million associates employed worldwide, 52% identify as women.  In the U.S., 50% of the approximately 1.6 million \\nassociates identify as people of color.\\nWe review our processes regarding our commitment to fair-pay practices.  We are committed to creating a performance culture \\nwhere associates are rewarded based on meaningful factors such as qualifications, experience, performance, and the work they \\ndo.  \\nTo build a company where associates feel engaged, valued and heard, we gather and respond to associates' feedback in a variety \\nof ways, including but not limited to our annual associate engagement survey, our Open Door process, and one-on-one \\ninteractions.  Management reviews the results of feedback obtained from our formal associate engagement survey.  \\nWell-being  - \\nFocus on the physical, emotional, and financial well-being of our associates.  We invest in our associates by \\noffering competitive wages, as well as a broad range of benefits that vary based on customary local practices and statutory \\nrequirements. In the U.S., we offer affordable healthcare coverage to our full-time and eligible part-time associates as well as \\ncompany paid benefits such as 401(k) match, family building support, maternity leave, a paid parental leave program to all full-\\ntime associates, paid time off, Associate Stock Purchase Plan match, life insurance, behavioral and mental health services, and a \\nstore discount card or Sam's Club membership.  Additional information about how we invest in our associates' well-being, \\nincluding wage structure and pay, can be found in our Human Capital brief in our most recent ESG reporting, which is available \\non our corporate website.  Nothing on our website, including our ESG reporting documents, or sections thereof, shall be \\ndeemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated by reference into any of our other \\nfilings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Certain information relating to retirement-related benefits we provide to \\nour associates is included in Note 11  t\\no our Consolidated Financial Statements. \\nGrowth  - \\nProvide ongoing growth, development and learning opportunities for associates and continue to attract talent with \\nnew skills.  We are invested in the growth of our associates in support of our business and their success by offering good jobs \\nthat lead to great careers and better lives.  We launched the global Walmart Academy to help associates build and grow their \\ncareers, creating one of the largest learning ecosystems in the world. The global Walmart Academy offers training for on-the-\\njob retail skills, leadership courses, and well-being training, serving associates through combination of  digital and in-person \\nofferings. The global focus builds on moving much more to a learning in the flow of work approach.\\nWe also provide access to educational opportunities for our part-time and full-time frontline eligible associates in the U.S. \\nthrough our Live Better U program, which provides access to earn a high school diploma or a college degree. Walmart pays \\n100% of associates' college tuition, books and fees. Our Live Better U program aligns education offerings with Walmart's own \\nareas of growth, providing opportunities for associates to become great at the job they have today and prepare for the job of \\ntomorrow. Approximately 75% of our U.S. salaried store, club and supply chain management started their careers in hourly \\npositions.  Our focus on providing a path of opportunity for our associates through robust training, competitive wages and \\nbenefits, and career advancement creates a strong associate value proposition and strengthens our workforce.\\nDigital  - \\nAccelerate digital transformation and ways of working to improve the associate experience and drive business results.  \\nTo deliver a seamless customer and associate experience, we continue to invest in digital tools like Me@Walmart, MyClub and \\nMe@Campus to improve associate productivity, engagement, and performance. The MyFeedback app was developed to capture \\nreal-time associate feedback. Walmart supports associates who are on the U.S. Medical Plan with free virtual visits which \\ninclude visits for medical doctor urgent care, along with mental health care with psychiatrist and psychologists. \\n13\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 14}), Document(page_content=\"Infor\\nmation About Our Executive Officers \\nThe following chart names the executive officers of the Company as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-\\nK with the SEC, each of whom is elected by and serves at the pleasure of the Board of Directors.

RISK\\n FACTORS\\nThe\\n risks described below could, in ways we may or may not be able to accurately predict, materially and adversely affect our \\nbusiness, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.  Our business operations could also be affected by additional \\nfactors that apply to all companies operating in the U.S. and globally. The following risk factors do not identify all risks that we \\nmay face.\\nStrategic Risks\\nFai\\nlure to successfully execute our omni-channel strategy and the cost of our investments in eCommerce and technology \\nmay materially adversely affect our market position, net sales and financial performance.\\nThe retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace digital shopping.  As a result, the portion of \\ntotal consumer expenditures with retailers and wholesale clubs occurring through digital platforms is increasing and the pace of \\nthis increase could continue to accelerate.  \\nOur strategy, which includes investments in eCommerce, technology, talent, supply chain automation, acquisitions, joint \\nventures, store remodels and other customer initiatives, may not adequately or effectively allow us to continue to grow our \\neCommerce business, increase comparable sales, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact on \\nthe growth of our business of a moderated pace of new store and club openings.  The success of this strategy will depend in \\nlarge measure on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping experience and \\ninterconnected ecosystem for our customers that deepens and maintains our relationships with our customers across our various \\nbusinesses and partnerships and reinforces our overall enterprise strategy. The success of this strategy is further subject to the \\nrelated risks discussed in this Item 1A .  W\\nith the interconnected components of this enterprise strategy and an increasing \\nallocation of capital expenditures focused on these initiatives, changes in customer or member perceptions about our reputation \\nor our failure to successfully execute on individual components of this strategy may adversely affect our market position, net \\nsales and financial performance which could also result in impairment charges to intangible assets or other long-lived assets.  In \\naddition, a greater concentration of eCommerce sales, including increasing online grocery sales, could result in a reduction in \\nthe amount of traffic in our stores and clubs, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store or cross-club sales of \\nmerchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and clubs and materially adversely affect our \\nfinancial performance.\\nFurthermore, the cost of certain investments in eCommerce, technology, talent, automation, including any operating losses \\nincurred, will adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and failure to realize the benefits of these \\ninvestments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term.\\nIf we do not timely identify or effectively respond to consumer trends or preferences, it could negatively affect our \\nrelationship with our customers, demand for the products and services we sell, our market share and the growth of our \\nbusiness.\\nIt is difficult to predict consistently and successfully the products and services our customers will demand and changes in their \\nshopping patterns.  The success of our business depends in part on how accurately we predict consumer demand, availability of \\nmerchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and services and the competitive environment.  Price \\ntransparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience, ease and the speed and cost of shipping are of primary \\nimportance to customers and continue to increase in importance, particularly as a result of digital tools and social media \\navailable to consumers and the choices available to consumers for purchasing products.  Our failure to adequately or effectively \\nrespond to changing consumer tastes, preferences (including those related to ESG issues) and shopping patterns, or any other \\nfailure on our part to timely identify or effectively respond to changing consumer tastes, preferences and shopping patterns \\ncould negatively affect our reputation and relationship with our customers, the demand for the products we sell or services we \\noffer, our market share and the growth of our business.\\nWe face strong competition from other retailers, wholesale club operators, omni-channel retailers, and other businesses \\nwhich could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\\nEach of our segments competes for customers, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important \\naspects of its business with many other local, regional, national and global physical, eCommerce and omni-channel retailers, \\nsocial commerce platforms, wholesale club operators and retail intermediaries, as well as companies that offer services in \\ndigital advertising, fulfillment and delivery services, health and wellness, and financial services.

Such consolidation, or other business combinations or alliances, competitive omni-\\nchannel ecosystems, or reductions in operations may result in competitors with greatly improved financial resources, improved \\naccess to merchandise, greater market penetration and other improvements in their competitive positions.  Such business \\ncombinations or alliances could allow these companies to provide a wider variety of products and services at competitive prices, \\nwhich could adversely affect our financial performance.\\nGeneral or macro-economic factors, both domestically and internationally, may materially adversely affect our financial \\nperformance.\\nGeneral economic conditions and other economic factors, globally or in one or more of the markets we serve, may adversely \\naffect our financial performance.

Customer behaviors changed rapidly during the \\ncourse of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In the event of a resurgence of infections or future mutations, variants or related strains of \\nthe virus become prevalent, customer demand for certain products may fluctuate and customer behaviors may change, which \\nmay challenge our ability to anticipate and/or adjust inventory levels to meet that demand.

These and other factors affecting our suppliers and our access to products could adversely affect our operations and \\nfinancial performance.\\nIf the products we sell are not safe or otherwise fail to meet our customers' expectations, we could lose customers, incur \\nliability for any injuries suffered by customers using or consuming a product we sell or otherwise experience a material \\nimpact to our brand, reputation and financial performance.  We are also subject to reputational and other risks related \\nto third-party sales on our digital platforms.\\nOur customers count on us to provide them with safe products.  Concerns regarding the safety of food and non-food products \\nthat we source from our suppliers or that we prepare and then sell could cause customers to avoid purchasing certain products \\nfrom us, or to seek alternative sources of supply for all of their food and non-food needs, even if the basis for the concern is \\noutside of our control.  Any lost confidence on the part of our customers would be difficult and costly to reestablish and such \\nproducts also expose us to product liability or food safety claims.  As such, any issue regarding the safety of any food or non-\\nfood items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation and financial performance.  In addition, \\nthird-parties sell goods on some of our digital platforms, which we refer to as marketplace transactions.  Whether laws related \\nto these marketplace transactions, including, but not limited to, intellectual property and products liability laws, apply to us is \\ncurrently unsettled and any unfavorable changes or interpretations could expose us to liability, loss of sales, reduction in \\ntransactions and deterioration of our competitive position.

We use social media, online advertising, and email to interact with our customers and as a means to \\nenhance their shopping experience.  As a part of our omni-channel sales strategy, we offer various pickup, delivery and \\nshipping programs including options where many products available for purchase online can be picked up by the customer or \\nmember at a local Walmart store or Sam's Club, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores and clubs.  Omni-\\nchannel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the retail industry and of our operations around the world, and we continue to \\nmake investments in supply chain automation to support our omni-channel strategy. We must anticipate and meet our \\ncustomers' changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations \\nthrough focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels by each operating \\nsegment.  Moreover, some of the various technology systems and services on which we rely are provided and managed by \\nthird-party service providers. To the extent either our or such other third-party systems and services do not perform or function \\nas anticipated, whether because of an inherent flaw in the technology or a faulty implementation, such failure can significantly \\ninterfere with our ability to meet our customers' changing expectations.

Mitigation and \\nremediation recommendations continue to evolve, and addressing vulnerabilities is a priority for us.  The increased use of \\nremote work infrastructure in recent years has also increased the possible attack surfaces.

Moreover, hardware, software or applications we use may have inherent vulnerabilities or defects of \\ndesign, manufacture or operations or could be inadvertently or intentionally implemented or used in a manner that could \\ncompromise information security. \\nAny compromise of our data security systems or of those of businesses with which we interact, which results in confidential \\ninformation being accessed, obtained, damaged, disclosed, destroyed, modified, lost or used by unauthorized persons could \\nharm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions (including, with respect to health information, liability under the Health \\nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or \"HIPAA\"), customer attrition, remediation expenses, and claims from \\ncustomers, members, associates, vendors, financial institutions, payment card networks and other persons, any of which could \\nmaterially and adversely affect our business operations, financial position and results of operations. Because the techniques \\nused to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may not immediately \\nproduce signs of a compromise, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative \\nmeasures and we or our third-party service providers may not discover any security event, breach, vulnerability or compromise \\nof information for a significant period of time after the security incident occurs. To the extent that any cyberattack, ransomware \\nor incursion in our or one of our third-party service provider\\'s information systems results in the loss, damage, misappropriation \\nor other compromise of information, we may be materially adversely affected by claims from customers, members, financial \\ninstitutions, regulatory authorities, payment card networks and others.\\nOur compliance programs, information technology, and enterprise risk management efforts cannot eliminate all systemic risk.  \\nDisruptions in our systems caused by security incidents, breaches or cyberattacks – including attacks on those parties we do \\nbusiness with (such as strategic partners, suppliers, banks, or utility companies) – could harm our ability to conduct our \\noperations, which may have a material effect on us, may result in losses that could have a material adverse effect on our \\nfinancial position or results of operations, or may have a cascading effect that adversely impacts our partners, third-party \\nservice providers, customers, members, financial services firms, and other third parties that we interact with on a regular basis.\\nOur reputation with our customers and members is important to the success of our enterprise strategy, which combines \\ntraditional retail, membership models, marketplaces, financial services, healthcare, and other customer and business services \\ninto a series of interconnected assets to make it seamless for customers to interact with us.

In \\ncertain circumstances, our contracts with payment card processors and payment card networks (such as Visa, Mastercard, \\nAmerican Express and Discover) generally require us to adhere to payment card network rules which could make us liable to \\npayment card issuers and others if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we process \\nis compromised, which liabilities could be substantial. \\nAdditionally, through various financial service partners and our ONE fintech joint venture, we offer various services such as \\nmoney transfers, digital payment platforms, bill payment, money orders, check cashing, prepaid access, co-branded credits \\ncards, installment lending, and earned wage access. These products and services require us to comply with legal and regulatory \\nrequirements, including privacy, authentication and tokenization, global anti-money laundering and sanctions laws and \\nregulations as well as international, federal and state consumer financial laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws \\nand regulations could result in fines, sanctions, penalties and harm to our reputation.\\nThe Company also has compliance obligations associated with privacy laws enacted to protect and regulate the collection, use, \\nretention, disclosure and transfer of personal information, which include liability for security and privacy breaches.  Among \\nother obligations, breaches may trigger obligations under international, federal and state laws to notify affected individuals, \\ngovernment agencies and the media.  Consequently, cybersecurity attacks that cause a data breach could subject us to fines, \\nsanctions and other legal liability and harm our reputation. \\nChanges in type or scope of offerings of our health and wellness business or the Walmart Health business could \\nadversely affect our overall results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\\nWalmart has retail pharmacy operations in our Walmart U.S. and Sam\\'s Club segments across the U.S. and in various of our \\ninternational markets such as Canada and Mexico. We also provide management services to Walmart Health centers that offer \\nmedical, dental, behavioral health and other health services in a number of states, as well as a national telehealth service \\nprovider. In addition, Walmart\\'s 10-year collaboration with UnitedHealth Group includes agreements for Walmart Health to \\nprovide value-based care to patients in certain areas of the U.S., among other initiatives. \\nA large majority of our retail pharmacy net sales are generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment through \\nestablished contractual relationships with third-party payers and payment administrators, such as private insurers, governmental \\nagencies and pharmacy benefit managers (\"PBMs\"). Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: \\nreductions in the third-party reimbursement rates for drugs; changes in our payer mix (i.e., shifts in the relative distribution of \\nour pharmacy customers across drug insurance plans and programs toward plans and programs with less favorable \\nreimbursement terms); changes in third-party payer drug formularies (i.e., the schedule of prescription drugs approved for \\nreimbursement or which otherwise receive preferential coverage treatment); growth in, and our participation in or exclusion \\nfrom, pharmacy payer network arrangements including exclusive and preferred pharmacy network arrangements operated by \\nPBMs and/or any insurance plan or program; increases in the prices we pay for brand name and generic prescription drugs we \\nsell; increases in the administrative burdens associated with seeking third-party reimbursement; changes in the frequency with \\nwhich new brand name pharmaceuticals become available to consumers; introduction of lower cost generic drugs as substitutes \\nfor existing brand name drugs for which there was no prior generic drug competition; changes in drug mix (i.e., the relative \\ndistribution of drugs customers purchase at our pharmacies between brands and generics); changes in the health insurance \\nmarket generally; changes in the scope of or the elimination of Medicare Part D or Medicaid drug programs; increased \\ncompetition from other retail pharmacy operations including competitors offering online retail pharmacy options and/or home \\ndelivery options; further consolidation and strategic alliances among third-party payers, PBMs or purchasers of drugs; overall \\neconomic conditions and the ability of our pharmacy customers to pay for drugs prescribed for them to the extent the costs are \\nnot reimbursed by a third-party; failure to meet any performance or incentive thresholds to which our level of third-party \\nreimbursement may be subject; changes in laws or regulations or the practices of third-party payers and PBMs related to the use \\nof third-party financial assistance to assist our pharmacy customers with paying for drugs prescribed for them; and any \\n21', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 22}), Document(page_content=\"addi\\ntional  changes in the state or federal regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical \\nindustry, including as a result of health reform efforts, and other changes to or novel interpretations of existing state or federal \\nlaws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business.\\nIf the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, our \\npharmacy operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could obtain a new supplier for such \\npharmaceuticals.  Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a significant number of our pharmacy \\ncustomers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies.\\nWalmart Health clinical operations are also subject to numerous risks, including but not limited to: reductions in the third-party \\nreimbursement rates for services; changes in our payer mix; changes in the health insurance market generally; our inability to \\nretain and negotiate favorable contracts with private third-party payers, including managed care plans; competition for patients \\nfrom other healthcare providers, including those that offer telehealth services; changes to healthcare provider utilization \\npractices and treatment methodologies; trends toward value-based purchasing and price transparency; overall economic \\nconditions and the ability of patients to pay for services; staffing challenges, including retention of a sufficient number and \\nquality of healthcare professionals; compliance with the complex and extensive laws and regulations governing the healthcare \\nindustry; changes in laws and regulations, including as a result of health reform efforts; and healthcare technology initiatives, \\nincluding those related to patient data and interoperability; and public health conditions.\\nOne or a combination of the factors above may adversely affect the volumes of brand name and generic pharmaceuticals we \\nsell, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the net sales and gross margin of those operations or \\nresult in the loss of cross-store or cross-club selling opportunities. In addition, these and other factors may adversely affect the \\ntype, volume and mix of services we provide, the reimbursement we receive for health and wellness services rendered, and the \\nscope and pace of expansion of Walmart Health and related offerings. Any of these developments could, in turn, adversely \\naffect our overall net sales, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\\nOur failure to attract and retain qualified associates, increases in wage and benefit costs, changes in laws and other \\nlabor issues could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\\nOur ability to continue to conduct and expand our operations depends on our ability to attract and retain a large and growing \\nnumber of qualified associates globally.  Our ability to meet our labor needs, including our ability to find qualified personnel to \\nfill positions that become vacant at our existing stores, clubs, distribution and fulfillment centers and corporate offices, while \\ncontrolling our associate wage and related labor costs, is generally subject to numerous external factors, including the \\navailability of a sufficient number of qualified persons in the work force of the markets in which we operate, unemployment \\nlevels within those markets, prevailing wage rates, changing demographics, health and other insurance costs and adoption of \\nnew or revised employment and labor laws and regulations. Additionally, our ability to successfully execute organizational \\nchanges, including our enterprise strategy and management transitions within the Company's senior leadership, and to \\neffectively motivate and retain associates are critical to our business success. We compete for talent with other retail and non-\\nretail businesses, including, for example, technology, health and wellness, and fintech businesses, and invest significant \\nresources in training and motivating our associates. Increased competition among potential employers at all levels, including \\nsenior management and executive levels, could result in increased associate costs or make it more difficult to recruit and retain \\nassociates.  If we are unable to locate, attract or retain qualified personnel, or manage leadership transition successfully, the \\nquality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our financial performance may be adversely affected.\\nIn addition, if our costs of labor or related costs increase for other reasons or if new, revised, or novel interpretations of existing \\nlabor laws, rules or regulations or healthcare laws are adopted or implemented that further increase our labor costs, our financial \\nperformance could be materially adversely affected.\\nFinancial Risks\\nFai\\nlure to meet market expectations for our financial performance could adversely affect the market price and volatility \\nof our stock.\\nWe believe that the price of our stock generally reflects high market expectations for our future operating results.  Any failure \\nto meet or delay in meeting these expectations, including our consolidated net sales, consolidated operating income, capital \\nexpenditures, comparable store and club sales growth rates, eCommerce growth rates, gross margin, or earnings and adjusted \\nearnings per share could cause the market price of our stock to decline, as could changes in our dividend or stock repurchase \\nprograms or policies, changes in our effective tax rates, changes in our financial estimates and recommendations by securities \\nanalysts or, failure of Walmart's performance to compare favorably to that of other retailers may have a negative effect on the \\nprice of our stock. \\n22\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 23}), Document(page_content=\"Fl\\nuctuations in foreign exchange rates may materially adversely affect our financial performance and our reported \\nresults of operations.\\nOur operations in countries other than the U.S. are conducted primarily in the local currencies of those countries.

Walmart \\nInternational's operations in various countries also source goods and services from other countries.  Our future operating results \\nin these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control.  These factors \\ninclude political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory \\nconstraints (such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership \\nrestrictions) on eCommerce and retail operations in international markets, such as India), restrictive governmental actions (such \\nas trade protection measures or nationalization), antitrust and competition law regulatory matters (such as the competition \\ninvestigations currently underway in Mexico related to our subsidiary Wal-Mart de Mexico, in Canada related to our subsidiary \\nWal-Mart Canada and competition proceedings in India related to our Flipkart subsidiary), local product safety and \\nenvironmental laws, tax regulations, local labor laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, foreign \\nexchange or currency regulations, laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, and other matters in any of the \\ncountries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.\\nThe economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and \\ncurrency devaluations, which, if they occurred again, could adversely affect our financial performance.  Other factors which \\nmay impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and of other countries, \\nlaws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with \\nhaving numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S.  Additional risks inherent in \\nour international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, \\nadverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S.  The \\nvarious risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also exist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be \\nexaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, geopolitical \\ntensions or events, laws and regulations.\\nIn foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention \\nof our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign \\nCorrupt Practices Act or the laws and regulations of other countries.  We maintain a global policy prohibiting such business \\npractices and have in place a global anti-corruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and \\nregulations.  Nevertheless, we remain subject to the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including \\nthose based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other \\ncountries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies, circumvent our compliance \\n23\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 24}), Document(page_content='progra\\nms and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations.  Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, \\ncould adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.\\nChanges in tax and trade laws and regulations could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\\nIn fiscal 2023, our Walmart U.S. and Sam\\'s Club operating segments generated approximately 83% of our consolidated net \\nsales. Significant changes in tax and trade policies, including tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the \\nU.S. and other countries where we source many of the products we sell in our stores and clubs could have an adverse effect on \\nour business and financial performance. A significant portion of the general merchandise we sell in our U.S. stores and clubs is \\nmanufactured in other countries.  Any such actions including the imposition of further tariffs on imports could increase the cost \\nto us of such merchandise (whether imported directly or indirectly) and cause increases in the prices at which we sell such \\nmerchandise to our customers, which could materially adversely affect the financial performance of our U.S. and international \\noperations as well as our business.\\nWe are subject to income taxes and other taxes in both the U.S. and the foreign jurisdictions in which we currently operate or \\nhave historically operated.  The determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and current and deferred tax assets \\nand liabilities requires judgment and estimation.  Our income taxes could be materially adversely affected by earnings being \\nlower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have \\nhigher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in worldwide tax \\nlaws, tax rates, regulations or accounting principles.\\nWe are also exposed to future tax legislation, as well as the issuance of future regulations and changes in administrative \\ninterpretations of existing tax laws, any of which can impact our current and future years\\' tax provision. The effect of such \\nchanges in tax law could have a material effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. In the U.S., the Tax \\nCuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") significantly changed federal income tax laws that affect U.S. corporations. As \\nfurther guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes in \\nour estimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. Compliance with the Tax Act and any other \\nnew tax rules, regulations, guidance, and interpretations, including collecting information not regularly produced by the \\nCompany or unexpected changes in our estimates, may require us to incur additional costs and could affect our results of \\noperations.\\nIn addition, legislatures and taxing authorities in many jurisdictions in which we operate may enact changes to or seek to \\nenforce novel interpretations of their tax rules. These changes could include modifications that have temporary effect and more \\npermanent changes.  For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (the \"OECD\"), the European \\nUnion and other countries (including countries in which we operate) have committed to enacting substantial changes to \\nnumerous long-standing tax principles impacting how large multinational enterprises are taxed. In particular, the OECD\\'s Pillar \\nTwo initiative introduces a 15% global minimum tax applied on a country-by-country basis and for which many jurisdictions \\nhave now committed to an effective enactment date starting January 1, 2024.  The impact of these potential new rules as well as \\nany other changes in domestic and international tax rules and regulations could have a material effect on our effective tax rate.\\nFurthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities as well as subject to the \\nprospective and retrospective effects of changing tax regulations and legislation.  Although we believe our tax estimates are \\nreasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may materially differ from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial \\nStatements and may materially affect our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which \\nsuch determination and settlement is made.\\nChanges in and/or failure to comply with other laws, regulations, and interpretations of such laws and regulations \\nspecific to the businesses and jurisdictions in which we operate  could materially adversely affect our reputation, market \\nposition, or our business and financial performance.\\nWe operate in complex regulated environments in the U.S. and in other countries in which we operate and could be materially \\nadversely affected by changes to existing legal requirements including the related interpretations and enforcement practices, \\nnew legal requirements and/or any failure to comply with applicable regulations.  In addition, the degree of regulatory, political, \\nand media scrutiny we face increases the likelihood that our efforts to adhere our practices and procedures to comply with these \\nlaws and legal requirements may be subject to frequent or increasing challenges.\\nOur health and wellness operations in the U.S. and the operations of the Walmart Health locations are subject to numerous \\nfederal, state and local laws and regulations including, but not limited to, those related to: licensing, reimbursement \\narrangements, and other requirements and restrictions; registration and regulation of pharmacies; dispensing and sale of \\ncontrolled substances and products containing pseudoephedrine; governmental and commercial reimbursement (including \\nMedicare and Medicaid); data privacy and security and the sharing and interoperability of data, including obligations and \\nrestrictions related to health information (such as those imposed under HIPAA); billing and coding for healthcare services and \\nproperly handling overpayments; debt collection; necessity and adequacy of healthcare services; relationships with referral \\nsources and referral recipients and other fraud and abuse issues, such as those addressed by anti-kickback and false claims laws \\nand patient inducement regulations; qualification of healthcare practitioners; quality and standards of medical services and \\n24', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 25}), Document(page_content='equi\\npment; and the practice of the professions of pharmacy, medical, dental, and behavioral healthcare services, including \\nlimitations on the corporate practice of medicine in certain states. \\nHealth-related legislation at the federal and state level may have an adverse effect on our business or require us to modify \\ncertain aspects of our operations.  For example, in the U.S., the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") and various other \\nregulatory authorities regulate the purchase, distribution, maintenance and dispensing of pharmaceuticals and controlled \\nsubstances.  We are required to hold valid DEA and state-level licenses, meet various security and operating standards and \\ncomply with the federal and various state controlled substance acts and related regulations governing the sale, dispensing, \\ndisposal and holding of controlled substances.  The DEA, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and state regulatory \\nauthorities have broad enforcement powers, including the ability to seize or recall products and impose significant criminal, \\ncivil and administrative sanctions for violations of these laws and regulations.  In addition, there has been recent heightened \\ngovernmental and public scrutiny of pharmaceutical product pricing, which has resulted in federal and state legislation and \\nregulations, executive orders and other initiatives and proposals designed to increase transparency in pharmaceutical product \\npricing and reform government program reimbursement methodologies (for example, the Inflation Reduction Act, which \\nincludes, among other matters, policies designed to impact drug prices and reduce drug spending by the federal government). \\nOther health reform efforts at the federal and state levels may also impact our business or require us to modify certain aspects of \\nour operations. We may not be able to predict the nature or success of reform initiatives, and the resulting uncertainties may \\nhave an adverse effect on our business. \\nWe are also governed by foreign, national and state laws and regulations of general applicability, including laws and regulations \\nrelated to competition and antitrust matters; protection of the environment and health and safety matters, including exposure to, \\nand the management and disposal of, hazardous substances; food and drug safety, including drug supply chain security \\nrequirements; trade, consumer protection, and safety, including the availability, sale, price label accuracy, advertisement, and \\npromotion of products we sell and the financial services we offer (including through our digital channels, stores and clubs as \\nwell as our ONE fintech joint venture); anti-money laundering prohibitions; consumer financial protection laws; economic, \\ntrade, and other sanctions matters; licensure, certification, and enrollment with government programs; data privacy and security \\nand the sharing and interoperability of data; working conditions, health and safety, equal employment opportunity, employee \\nbenefit and other labor and employment matters; and health and wellness related regulations for our pharmacy operations \\noutside of the U.S.  In addition, certain financial services we offer or make available are subject to legal and regulatory \\nrequirements, including those intended to help detect and prevent money laundering, fraud and other illicit activity as well as \\nconsumer financial protections laws and U.S. sanctions.  Increasing governmental and societal attention to ESG matters, \\nincluding expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting diligence, and disclosure topics such as climate change, sustainability \\n(including with respect to our supply chain), natural resources, waste reduction, energy, human capital, and risk oversight could \\nexpand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report.\\nMoreover, we are also subject to data privacy and protection laws regulating the collection, use, retention, disclosure, transfer \\nand processing of personal information, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\"), which was significantly \\nmodified by the California Privacy Rights Act (\"CPRA\"), new comprehensive privacy legislation passed in Connecticut (the \\nConnecticut Data Protection Act), Colorado (the Colorado Privacy Act), Utah (the Utah Privacy Act) and Virginia (the \\nConsumer Data Protection Act), each of which go into effect in 2023, as well as other laws and regulations such as the Illinois \\nBiometric Information Privacy Act,  the European Union\\'s General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), the United \\nKingdom\\'s General Data Protection Regulation (which implements the GDPR into U.K. law), China\\'s Personal Information \\nProtection Act, and similar legislation in Quebec (An Act to modernize legislative provisions as regards the protection of \\npersonal information, SQ 2021, c 25). The potential effects of these laws are far-reaching, continue to evolve, and may require \\nus to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses to comply. These and other \\nprivacy and cybersecurity laws may carry significant potential penalties for noncompliance. For example, in the case of non-\\ncompliance with a material provision of the GDPR (such as non-adherence to the core principles of processing personal data), \\nregulators have the authority to levy a fine in an amount that is up to the greater of €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover \\nin the prior year. These administrative fines are discretionary and based, in each case, on a multi-factored approach.  Residents \\nin jurisdictions with comprehensive privacy laws have expanded rights to access, correct and require deletion of their personal \\ninformation, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal \\ninformation is used. Laws such as those in California, Connecticut, Colorado, Illinois, Utah, and Virginia may allow civil \\npenalties for violations, and CCPA and CPRA provide a private right of action for data breaches.  Furthermore, our marketing \\nand customer engagement activities are subject to communications privacy laws such as the Telephone Consumer Protection \\nAct. We may be subjected to penalties and other consequences for noncompliance, including changing some portions of our \\nbusiness.  Even an unsuccessful challenge by customer or regulatory authorities of our activities could result in adverse \\npublicity, impact our reputation and could require a costly response from and defense by us.\\nThe impact of new laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations, as well as changes in enforcement practices or \\nregulatory scrutiny as to existing laws and regulations (including, but not limited to, in the U.S., shifting enforcement priorities \\nfor existing antitrust, competition, and pricing laws, as well as proposed new rules and regulations) generally cannot be \\npredicted, and changes in applicable laws, regulations and policies and the related interpretations and enforcement practices of \\n25', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 26}), Document(page_content='exi\\nsting laws and regulations may require extensive system and operational changes, be difficult to implement, increase our \\noperating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the cost or attractiveness of the products or \\nservices we offer, or result in adverse publicity and harm our reputation. If we fail to predict or respond adequately to changes, \\nincluding by implementing strategic and operational initiatives, or do not respond as effectively as our competitors, our \\nbusiness, operations, and financial performance may be adversely affected.\\nIn addition, we may face audits or investigations by one or more government agencies relating to our compliance with \\napplicable laws and regulations.  The regulatory, political, and media scrutiny we face, which may continue, amplifies these \\nrisks.  To the extent a regulator or court disagrees with our interpretation of these laws and determines that our practices are not \\nin compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties that could adversely \\naffect the continued operation of our businesses, including: suspension of payments from government programs; loss of \\nrequired licenses and certifications; loss of authorizations to participate in or exclusion from government programs, including \\nthe Medicare and Medicaid programs in the U.S.; termination from contractual relationships, including those with our drug \\nsuppliers and third-party payers; and significant fines or monetary damages.  Failure to comply with applicable legal or \\nregulatory requirements in the U.S. or in any of the countries in which we operate could result in significant legal and financial \\nexposure, damage to our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial position and results \\nof operations.\\nWe are subject to risks related to litigation and other legal proceedings that may materially adversely affect our results \\nof operations, financial position and liquidity.\\nWe operate in a highly regulated and litigious environment.  We are involved in legal proceedings, including litigation, \\narbitration and other claims, and investigations, inspections, audits, claims, inquiries and similar actions by pharmacy, \\nhealthcare, tax, environmental and other governmental authorities.  We may also have indemnification obligations for legal \\ncommitments of certain businesses we have divested. Legal proceedings, in general, and securities, derivative action and class \\naction and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some of these suits may purport or may be \\ndetermined to be class actions and/or involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate amounts, including punitive or \\nexemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years.  For example, we are currently a defendant in a number of \\ncases containing class or collective-action allegations, or both, in which the plaintiffs have brought claims under federal and \\nstate wage and hour laws, as well as a number of cases containing class-action allegations in which the plaintiffs have brought \\nclaims under federal and state consumer laws.\\nThe Company has been responding to subpoenas, information requests and investigations from governmental entities related to \\nnationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution practices involving opioids and also is a defendant in numerous \\nlitigation proceedings related to opioids, including the consolidated multidistrict litigation entitled In re National Prescription \\nOpiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) currently pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Similar cases \\nthat name the Company also have been filed in state courts by state, local and tribal governments, healthcare providers and \\nother plaintiffs. Plaintiffs are seeking compensatory and punitive damages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement.  \\nThe Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of \\nloss that may arise from such claims and the related opioid matters. In addition, in July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in \\nIndia issued a show cause notice to Flipkart and other parties requesting the recipients show cause as to why further \\nproceedings under India\\'s Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations should not be initiated against them based on alleged \\nviolations that related to a period prior to the Company\\'s acquisition of a majority stake in Flipkart in 2018.  The Company can \\nprovide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the notice, the amount of proceeds the \\nCompany may receive in indemnification, and can provide no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to \\nits business or its consolidated financial statements. The Company is also a defendant in litigation with the Federal Trade \\nCommission regarding the Company\\'s money transfer agent services and is also cooperating with and responding to subpoenas \\nissued by the U.S Attorney\\'s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice \\nregarding the Company\\'s consumer fraud prevention program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the Company\\'s \\nmoney transfer services, where Walmart is an agent.

We provide the following additional \\ninformation concerning those legal proceedings, including the name of the lawsuit, the court in which the lawsuit is pending, \\nand the date on which the petition commencing the lawsuit was filed.\\nPrescription Opiate Litigation: In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the \"MDL\"). The MDL is \\npending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio and includes over 2,000 cases as of March 3, 2023. The \\nliability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases against a number of parties, including the Company, \\nregarding opioid dispensing claims resulted in a jury verdict on November 23, 2021, finding in favor of the plaintiffs as to the \\nliability of all defendants, including the Company. The abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment \\non August 17, 2022, that ordered all three defendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately \\n$651 million over fifteen years, on a joint and several liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. The Company \\nhas filed an appeal with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and \\nthe injunctive portion of the judgment went into effect on February 20, 2023. The MDL has designated five additional single-\\ncounty cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery. In addition, there are over 300 other cases pending in state and \\nfederal courts throughout the country as of March 3, 2023. The case citations and currently scheduled trial dates, where \\napplicable, are listed on Exhibit 99.1 to this Form 10-K.\\nOpioid Settlement Framework: On November 15, 2022, the Company announced that it had agreed to a Settlement \\nFramework to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and \\nNative American tribes (other than the single, two-county trial on appeal to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals as described \\nabove), as described in more detail in Note 10 to t\\nhe Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company now has settlement \\nagreements with all 50 states, including four states that previously settled with the Company, as well as the District of \\nColumbia, Puerto Rico, and three other U.S. territories, that are intended to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits \\nbrought by state and local governments against the Company. The settlement will take effect if a sufficient number of political \\nsubdivisions also join.\\nDOJ Opioid Civil Litigation: A civil complaint pending in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware has been filed \\nby the U.S. Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") against the Company, in which the DOJ alleges violations of the Controlled \\nSubstances Act related to nationwide distribution and dispensing of opioids. U.S. v. Walmart Inc., et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, \\n12/22/20. The Company filed a motion to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After the parties had fully briefed \\nthe Company\\'s motion to dismiss, the DOJ filed an amended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the \\nCompany filed a partial motion to dismiss the amended complaint. The motion remains pending.\\nOpioids Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation: Three derivative complaints and two securities class \\nactions drawing heavily on the allegations of the DOJ complaint have been filed in Delaware naming the Company and various \\ncurrent and former directors and certain current and former officers as defendants. The plaintiffs in the derivative suits (in \\nwhich the Company is a nominal defendant) allege, among other things, that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties in \\nconnection with oversight of opioids dispensing and distribution and that the defendants violated Section 14(a) of the Securities \\nExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"), and are liable for contribution under Section 10(b) of the Exchange \\nAct in connection with the Company\\'s disclosures about opioids. Two of the derivative suits have been filed in the U.S. District \\nCourt in Delaware and those suits have been stayed pending further developments in other opioids litigation matters. The other \\nderivative suit has been filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery. The defendants in the derivative suit pending in the Delaware \\nCourt of Chancery moved to dismiss and/or to stay that case on December 21, 2021; the plaintiffs responded by filing an \\namended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss and/or stay proceedings on the \\namended complaint. The court held a hearing on that motion on September 26, 2022; a ruling remains pending. The securities \\nclass actions, alleging violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act regarding the Company\\'s disclosures with \\nrespect to opioids, purport to be filed on behalf of a class of investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016, \\nthrough December 22, 2020. On May 11, 2021, the U.S. District Court in Delaware consolidated the class actions and \\nappointed a lead plaintiff and lead counsel. The defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated securities class action on October \\n8, 2021. On October 14, 2022, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which revised the applicable putative class of investors to \\nthose who acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017, through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the Company \\nmoved to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending. \\nDerivative Lawsuits: Abt v. Alvarez et al., USDC, Dist. of DE, 2/9/21; Nguyen v.

CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS: \\nForeign Direct Investment Matters: In July 2021, the Directorate of Enforcement in India issued a show cause notice to \\nFlipkart Private Limited and one of its subsidiaries (\"Flipkart\"), and to unrelated companies and individuals, including certain \\ncurrent and former shareholders and directors of Flipkart. The notice requests the recipients to show cause as to why further \\nproceedings under India\\'s Foreign Direct Investment rules and regulations (the \"Rules\") should not be initiated against them \\nbased on alleged violations during the period from 2009 to 2015, prior to the Company\\'s acquisition of a majority stake in \\nFlipkart in 2018. The notice is an initial stage of proceedings under the Rules which could, depending upon the conclusions at \\nthe end of the initial stage, lead to a hearing to consider the merits of the allegations described in the notice. If a hearing is \\ninitiated and if it is determined that violations of the Rules occurred, the regulatory authority has the authority to impose \\nmonetary and/or non-monetary relief. Flipkart has begun the process of responding to the notice and, if the matter progresses to \\na consideration of the merits of the allegations described in the notice is initiated, Flipkart intends to defend against the \\nallegations vigorously. Due to the fact that this process is in an early stage, the Company is unable to predict whether the notice \\nwill lead to a hearing on the merits or, if it does, the final outcome of the resulting proceedings. While the Company does not \\ncurrently believe that this matter will have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations or \\ncash flows, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope or outcome of any proceeding that might result from the \\nnotice, the amount of the proceeds the Company may receive in indemnification from individuals and entities that sold shares to \\nthe Company under the 2018 agreement pursuant to which the Company acquired its majority stake in Flipkart, and can provide \\nno assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its business or its consolidated financial statements.  \\nIII. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS: Item 103 of SEC Regulation S-K requires disclosure of certain environmental matters \\nwhen a governmental authority is a party to the proceedings and such proceedings involve potential monetary sanctions that the \\nCompany reasonably believes will exceed an applied threshold not to exceed $1 million.  \\nIn December 2021, the Office of the Attorney General of the State of California filed suit against the Company, bringing \\nenforcement claims regarding Walmart\\'s management of waste consumer products at its California facilities that are alleged to \\nbe hazardous. The suit was filed in Superior Court of Alameda County, California, Case No. 21CV004367, People v. Walmart \\nInc., and a trial date has been scheduled for April 22, 2024. The Company believes the suit is without merit and is vigorously \\ndefending this litigation matter. While the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter, the potential for \\npenalties or settlement costs could exceed $1 million. Although the Company does not believe that this matter will have a \\nmaterial adverse effect on its business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, the Company can provide no \\nassurance as to the scope and outcome of this matter and no assurance as to whether there will be a material adverse effect to its \\nbusiness or its consolidated financial statements.\\nITEM 4.MINE\\n SAFETY DISCLOSURES\\nNot\\n applicable.\\n32', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 33}), Document(page_content='PART\\n II\\nIT\\nEM 5.

MANAG\\nEMENT\\'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF \\nOP\\nERATIONS\\nOve\\nrview\\nThis discussion, which presents our results for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023 (\"fiscal 2023\"), January 31, 2022 (\"fiscal \\n2022\") and January 31, 2021 (\"fiscal 2021\"), should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the \\naccompanying notes.  We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our \\nfinancial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period and the primary factors \\nthat accounted for those changes.  We also discuss certain performance metrics that management uses to assess the Company\\'s \\nperformance.  Additionally, the discussion provides information about the financial results of each of the three segments to \\nprovide a better understanding of how each of those segments and its results of operations affect the financial position and \\nresults of operations of the Company as a whole.\\nThroughout this Item 7, we discuss segment operating income, comparable store and club sales and other measures.  \\nManagement measures the results of the Company\\'s segments using each segment\\'s operating income, including certain \\ncorporate overhead allocations, as well as other measures.  From time to time, we revise the measurement of each segment\\'s \\noperating income and other measures as determined by the information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision \\nmaker. \\nManagement also measures the results of comparable store and club sales, or comparable sales, a metric that indicates the \\nperformance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales for such stores and clubs, for a particular period \\nfrom the corresponding period in the previous year.  Walmart\\'s definition of comparable sales includes sales from stores and \\nclubs open for the previous 12 months, including remodels, relocations, expansions and conversions, as well as eCommerce \\nsales.  We measure the eCommerce sales impact by including all sales initiated digitally, including omni-channel transactions \\nwhich are fulfilled through our stores and clubs as well as certain other business offerings that are part of our flywheel strategy, \\nsuch as our Walmart Connect advertising business.  Sales at a store that has changed in format are excluded from comparable \\nsales when the conversion of that store is accompanied by a relocation or expansion that results in a change in the store\\'s retail \\nsquare feet of more than five percent.  Sales related to divested businesses are excluded from comparable sales, and sales \\nrelated to acquisitions are excluded until such acquisitions have been owned for 12 months.  Comparable sales are also referred \\nto as \"same-store\" sales by others within the retail industry.  The method of calculating comparable sales varies across the retail \\nindustry.  As a result, our calculation of comparable sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by \\nother companies.\\nIn discussing our operating results, the term currency exchange rates refers to the currency exchange rates we use to convert the \\noperating results for countries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar into U.S. dollars.  We calculate the effect of \\nchanges in currency exchange rates as the difference between current period activity translated using the current period\\'s \\ncurrency exchange rates and the comparable prior year period\\'s currency exchange rates. Additionally, no currency exchange \\nrate fluctuations are calculated for non-USD acquisitions until owned for 12 months.  Throughout our discussion, we refer to \\nthe results of this calculation as the impact of currency exchange rate fluctuations.  Volatility in currency exchange rates may \\nimpact the results, including net sales and operating income, of the Company and the Walmart International segment in the \\nfuture.\\nWe have taken certain strategic actions to strengthen our portfolio, primarily in the Walmart International segment, including \\nthe following highlights over the last three years:\\n• In November 2020, we completed the sale of Walmart Argentina and recorded a pre-tax non-cash loss in fiscal 2021 of \\n$1.0 billion, primarily due to cumulative foreign currency translation losses.  Refer to Note 12.\\n• I n Fe\\nbruary 2021, we completed the sale of Asda for net consideration of $9.6 billion, for which we recognized an \\nestimated pre-tax loss in fiscal 2021 of $5.5 billion, and an incremental loss of $0.2 billion in fiscal 2022 upon closing \\nof the transaction. Refer to Note 11  a\\nnd Note 12 .\\n•In Ma\\nrch 2021, we completed the sale of Seiyu for net consideration of $1.2 billion, for which we recognized an \\nestimated pre-tax loss in fiscal 2021 of $1.9 billion, and an incremental loss of $0.2 billion in fiscal 2022 upon closing \\nof the transaction.

At times, we adjust our business strategies to maintain and strengthen our competitive positions in the countries in which \\nwe operate.  We define our financial framework as:\\n• strong, efficient growth;\\n• consistent operating discipline; and\\n• strategic capital allocation.\\nAs we execute on this financial framework, we believe our returns on capital will improve over time.\\nStrong, Efficient Growth\\nOur obj\\nective of prioritizing strong, efficient growth means we will focus on the most productive growth opportunities, \\nincreasing comparable store and club sales through increasing membership at Sam\\'s Club and through Walmart+, accelerating \\neCommerce sales growth and expanding omni-channel initiatives that complement our flywheel strategy.  At times, we make \\nstrategic investments which are focused on the long-term growth of the Company.\\nComparable sales is a metric that indicates the performance of our existing stores and clubs by measuring the change in sales \\nfor such stores and clubs, including eCommerce sales, for a particular period over the corresponding period in the previous \\nyear.  The retail industry generally reports comparable sales using the retail calendar (also known as the 4-5-4 calendar).  To be \\nconsistent with the retail industry, we provide comparable sales using the retail calendar in our quarterly earnings releases.  \\nHowever, when we discuss our comparable sales below, we are referring to our calendar comparable sales calculated using our \\nfiscal calendar, which may result in differences when compared to comparable sales using the retail calendar. \\nCalendar comparable sales, including the impact of fuel, for fiscal 2023 and 2022, were as follows:\\n Fiscal Years En\\nded January 31,\\n 2023 2022 2023 2022\\n With Fuel Fuel Impact\\nWalmart U.S. 7.0% 6.4% 0.4% 0.3%\\nSam\\'s Club 14.6% 15.0% 4.2% 5.5%\\nTotal U.S. 8.2% 7.7% 1.0% 1.2%\\nCom\\nparable sales in the U.S., including fuel, increased 8.2% and 7.7% in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, when compared to \\nthe previous fiscal year.

For fiscal 2022, comparable sales growth was \\ndriven driven by growth in average ticket and transactions, which included strong consumer spending from government \\nstimulus and some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. Walmart U.S. \\neCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 0.7% to comparable sales for both fiscal 2023 and 2022 as we continue \\nto focus on a seamless omni-channel experience for our customers.  \\nComparable sales at Sam\\'s Club increased 14.6% and 15.0% in fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.  For fiscal 2023, Sam\\'s Club \\ncomparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket and included higher inflation impacts in certain \\nmerchandise categories. Sam\\'s Club comparable sales for fiscal 2022 benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket \\nand was aided by consumer spending due to government stimulus, and also included some higher inflation impacts in certain \\nmerchandise categories compared to recent years.  The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to \\nremove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam\\'s Club eCommerce sales posi\\ntively contributed approximately 0.8% a\\nnd 1.3% \\nto comparable sales for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively. \\nConsistent Operating Discipline\\nWe\\n operate with discipline by managing expenses, optimizing the efficiency of how we work and creating an environment in \\nwhich we have sustainable lowest cost to serve.  We invest in technology and process improvements to increase productivity, \\nmanage inventory and reduce costs.  We measure operating discipline through expense leverage, which we define as net sales \\ngrowing at a faster rate than operating, selling, general and administrative (\"operating\") expenses.  \\nFiscal Years En\\nded January 31,\\n(Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022\\nNet sales $ 605,881 $ 567,762 \\nPercentage change from comparable period  6.7 %  2.3 %\\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses $ 127,140 $ 117,812 \\nPercentage change from comparable period  7.9 %  1.3 %\\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales  21.0 %  20.8 %\\nFor fi\\nscal 2023, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 23 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal \\nyear. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were impacted by charges of $3.3 billion related to opioid-related legal \\nsettlements and charges of $0.8 billion related to the reorganization and restructuring of certain businesses in the Walmart \\nInternational segment.  These charges were partially offset by growth in net sales and lower incremental COVID-19 costs.\\nFor fiscal 2022, operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 19 basis points when compared to the previous fiscal \\nyear. Operating expenses as a percentage of net sales benefited from growth in comparable sales and lower incremental \\nCOVID-19 related costs of $2.5 billion as compared to the previous year, partially offset by increased wage investments \\nprimarily in the Walmart U.S. segment.\\nStrategic Capital Allocation\\nOur st\\nrategy includes improving our customer-facing initiatives in stores and clubs and creating a seamless omni-channel \\nexperience for our customers.  As such, we continue to allocate more capital to supply chain, omni-channel initiatives, \\ntechnology and store remodels and less to new store and club openings.

We also provide returns in the form of share \\nrepurchases and dividends, which are discussed in the Liquidity and Capital Resources  se\\nction.\\nReturn on Assets and Return on Investment \\nWe include Return on Assets (\"ROA\"), the most directly comparable measure based on our financial statements presented in \\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (\"GAAP\"), and Return on Investment (\"ROI\") as metrics \\n37', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 38}), Document(page_content=\"to a\\nssess returns on assets.  While ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure, management believes ROI is a \\nmeaningful metric to share with investors because it helps investors assess how effectively Walmart is deploying its assets.  \\nTrends in ROI can fluctuate over time as management balances long-term strategic initiatives with possible short-term impacts.  \\nROA was 4.6% and 5.6% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively.  The decrease in ROA was primarily due to the decrease in net \\nincome, which was driven by lower operating income, partially offset by lapping debt extinguishment charges.\\t\\tROI was 12.7% \\nand 14.9% for fiscal 2023 and 2022, respectively, which was primarily due to a decrease in operating income which included \\ncharges associated with opioid-related legal settlements as well as reorganization and restructuring expenses, all recorded in \\nfiscal 2023.  \\nWe define ROI as adjusted operating income (operating income plus interest income, depreciation and amortization, and rent \\nexpense) for the trailing twelve months divided by average invested capital during that period.  We consider average invested \\ncapital to be the average of our beginning and ending total assets, plus average accumulated depreciation and average \\namortization, less average accounts payable and average accrued liabilities for that period.\\nOur calculation of ROI is considered a non-GAAP financial measure because we calculate ROI using financial measures that \\nexclude and include amounts that are included and excluded in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.  For \\nexample, we exclude the impact of depreciation and amortization from our reported operating income in calculating the \\nnumerator of our calculation of ROI. As mentioned above, we consider ROA to be the financial measure computed in \\naccordance with GAAP most directly comparable to our calculation of ROI.  ROI differs from ROA (which is consolidated net \\nincome for the period divided by average total assets for the period) because ROI: adjusts operating income to exclude certain \\nexpense items and adds interest income; and adjusts total assets for the impact of accumulated depreciation and amortization, \\naccounts payable and accrued liabilities to arrive at total invested capital.  Because of the adjustments mentioned above, we \\nbelieve ROI more accurately measures how we are deploying our key assets and is more meaningful to investors than ROA.  \\nAlthough ROI is a standard financial measure, numerous methods exist for calculating a company's ROI.  As a result, the \\nmethod used by management to calculate our ROI may differ from the methods used by other companies to calculate their ROI.\\nThe calculation of ROA and ROI, along with a reconciliation of ROI to the calculation of ROA, the most comparable GAAP \\nfinancial measure, is as follows: \\n Fiscal Years En\\nded January 31,\\n(Amounts in millions) 2023 2022\\nCALCULATION OF RETURN ON ASSETS\\nNumerator\\nConsolidated net income $ 11,292 $ 13,940 \\nDenominator\\nAverage total assets(1)$ 244,029 $ 248,678 \\nReturn on assets (ROA)  4.6 %  5.6 %\\nCALCULATION OF RETURN ON INVESTMENT\\nNumerator\\nOperating income $ 20,428 $ 25,942 \\n+ Interest income  254  158 \\n+ Depreciation and amortization  10,945  10,658 \\n+ Rent  2,306  2,274 \\nROI operating income $ 33,933 $ 39,032 \\nDenominator\\nAverage total assets(1)$ 244,029 $ 248,678 \\n  + Average accumulated depreciation and amortization(1) 106,249  98,199 \\n- Average accounts payable(1) 54,502  52,201 \\n- Average accrued liabilities(1) 28,593  32,013 \\nAverage invested capital $ 267,183 $ 262,663 \\nReturn on investment (ROI)  12.7 %  14.9 %\\n (1)  T\\nhe average is based on the addition of the account balance at the end of the current period to the account balance at the end of the prior period and dividing \\nby 2.\\n As of Jan\\nuary 31,\\n 2023 2022 2021\\nCertain Balance Sheet Data \\nTotal assets $ 243,197 $ 244,860 $ 252,496 \\nAccumulated depreciation and amortization  110,286  102,211  94,187 \\nAccounts payable  53,742  55,261  49,141 \\nAccrued liabilities  31,126  26,060  37,966 \\n38\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 39}), Document(page_content='Fre\\ne Cash Flow\\nFree cash flow is considered a non-GAAP financial measure.  Management believes, however, that free cash flow, which \\nmeasures our ability to generate additional cash from our business operations, is an important financial measure for use in \\nevaluating the Company\\'s financial performance.  Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute \\nfor, consolidated net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our \\nliquidity.  See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources \" for di\\nscussions of GAAP metrics including net cash provided by operating \\nactivities, net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.\\nWe define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities in a period minus payments for property and equipment \\nmade in that period.  We had net cash provided by operating activities of $28.8 billion, $24.2 billion and $36.1 billion for fiscal \\n2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2023 increased when compared to fiscal \\n2022. The increase is primarily due to moderated levels of inventory purchases, partially offset by a decline in operating income \\nand the timing of certain payments.  Free cash flow for fiscal 2023 increased when compared to fiscal 2022 due to the increase \\nin operating cash flows described above, partially offset by an increase of $3.8 billion in capital expenditures to support our \\ninvestment strategy.  Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2022 decreased when compared to fiscal 2021 \\nprimarily due to an increase in inventory costs and purchases to support strong sales and lapping the impact of accelerated \\ninventory sell-through in fiscal 2021, as well as timing and payment of wages. Free cash flow for fiscal 2022 decreased when \\ncompared to fiscal 2021 due to the same reasons as the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities, as well as $2.8 \\nbillion in increased capital expenditures.\\nWalmart\\'s definition of free cash flow is limited in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary \\nexpenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual \\nobligations or payments made for business acquisitions.  Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a \\nmeasure that provides supplemental information to our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows .\\nAl\\nthough other companies report their free cash flow, numerous methods may exist for calculating a company\\'s free cash flow. \\nAs a result, the method used by management to calculate our free cash flow may differ from the methods used by other \\ncompanies to calculate their free cash flow.\\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net cash provided by \\noperating activities, which we believe to be the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to free cash flow, as well as \\ninformation regarding net cash used in investing activities and net cash used in financing activities.\\n Fiscal Years En\\nded January 31,\\n(Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021\\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 28,841 $ 24,181 $ 36,074 \\nPayments for property and equipment  (16,857)  (13,106)  (10,264) \\nFree cash flow $ 11,984 $ 11,075 $ 25,810 \\nNet cash used in investing activities(1)$ (17,722) $ (6,015) $ (10,071) \\nNet cash used in financing activities  (17,039)  (22,828)  (16,117) \\n(1)  \"Net cash used in investing activities\" includes payments for\\n property and equipment, which is also included in our computation of free cash flow.\\n39', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 40}), Document(page_content=\"Re\\nsults of Operations\\nConsolidated Results of Operations\\nFiscal Years En\\nded January 31,\\n(Amounts in millions, except unit counts) 2023 2022 2021\\nTotal revenues $ 611,289 $ 572,754 $ 559,151 \\nPercentage change from comparable period  6.7 %  2.4 %  6.7 %\\nNet sales $ 605,881 $ 567,762 $ 555,233 \\nPercentage change from comparable period  6.7 %  2.3 %  6.8 %\\nTotal U.S. calendar comparable sales increase  8.2 %  7.7 %  8.7 %\\nGross profit rate  23.5 %  24.4 %  24.3 %\\nOperating income $ 20,428 $ 25,942 $ 22,548 \\nOperating income as a percentage of net sales  3.4 %  4.6 %  4.1 %\\nLoss on extinguishment of debt $ — $ 2,410 $ — \\nOther (gains) and losses $ 1,538 $ 3,000 $ (210) \\nConsolidated net income $ 11,292 $ 13,940 $ 13,706 \\nUnit counts at period end(1) 10,623  10,593  11,443 \\nRetail square feet at period end(1) 1,056  1,060  1,121 \\n(1)   \\nUnit counts and associated retail square feet are presented for stores and clubs generally open as of period end, and reflects the removal of stores in the \\nU.K. and Japan subsequent to closing the divestitures in fiscal 2022.

Our cash flows \\nprovided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund \\nour operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations.  Generally, some or \\nall of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases.  We \\nbelieve our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay \\ndividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.\\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\\nFiscal Years En\\nded January 31,\\n(Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021\\nNet cash provided by operating activities $ 28,841 $ 24,181 $ 36,074 \\nNe\\nt cash provided by operating activities was $28.8 billion, $24.2 billion and $36.1 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, \\nrespectively.  Net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2023 increased when compared to the previous fiscal year. The \\nincrease is primarily due to moderated levels of inventory purchases, partially offset by a decline in operating income and the \\ntiming of certain payments.  The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2022, when compared to the \\nprevious fiscal year, was primarily due to an increase in inventory costs and purchases to support strong sales and lapping the \\nimpact of accelerated inventory sell-through in fiscal 2021, as well as timing and payment of wages. \\nCash Equivalents and Working Capital Deficit \\nCash and cash equivalents were $8.6 billion and $14.8 billion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.  Our working \\ncapital deficit, defined as total current assets less total current liabilities, was $16.5 billion and $6.3 billion as of January 31, \\n2023 and 2022, respectively.  The increase in our working capital deficit is primarily driven by a decrease in cash and cash \\nequivalents and an increase in accrued liabilities.  We generally operate with a working capital deficit due to our efficient use of \\ncash in funding operations, consistent access to the capital markets and returns provided to our shareholders in the form of \\npayments of cash dividends and share repurchases. \\nWe use intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in which it is \\nneeded with the minimum cost possible. Additionally, from time-to-time, we repatriate earnings and related cash from \\njurisdictions outside of the U.S.  Historically, U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment \\nof U.S. tax reform, repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. federal tax, but may incur other taxes such as \\nwithholding or state taxes.

In preparing the Company\\'s Consolidated Financial \\nStatements, we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.  These principles require us to make certain \\nestimates and apply judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations as reflected in our financial statements.  \\nThese judgments and estimates are based on past events and expectations of future outcomes.  Actual results may differ from \\nour estimates.\\nManagement continually reviews our accounting policies including how they are applied and how they are reported and \\ndisclosed in our financial statements.  Following is a summary of our critical accounting estimates and how they are applied in \\npreparation of the financial statements.\\nInventories\\nThe Walmart U.S. segment comprises the largest portion of our inventory and is primarily accounted for under the retail \\ninventory method of accounting to determine inventory cost, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") valuation method.  The \\nmajority of the Sam\\'s Club segment inventories are accounted for and valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method. \\nWhen necessary, we record a LIFO provision for the estimated annual effect of inflation, and these estimates are adjusted to \\nactual results determined at year-end.  As a measure of sensitivity, an incremental 1% inflationary impact to the cost of our \\ninventory purchases would not have resulted in a material increase to the LIFO provision recorded during fiscal 2023.\\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\\nIntangible assets acquired in a business combination are stated at the fair value acquired as determined by a valuation technique \\ncommensurate with the intended use of the related asset.  Significant estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include, but \\nare not limited to, the amount and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, discount rates and useful lives.  Indefinite-lived \\nacquired intangible assets are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in \\ncircumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired.  Generally, this evaluation begins with a qualitative \\nassessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary.  If we determine, after performing an assessment \\nbased on qualitative factors, that the fair value of the indefinite-lived acquired intangible asset is more likely than not less than \\nthe carrying amount, then a quantitative impairment test would be performed.  The quantitative test for impairment requires \\nmanagement to make judgments relating to future cash flows, growth rates and economic and market conditions.  Our \\nindefinite-lived acquired intangible assets have historically generated sufficient returns to recover their cost.  Because of the \\nnature of the factors used in these tests, if different conditions occur in future periods, future operating results could be \\nmaterially impacted. \\nContingencies\\nWe are involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. We record a liability when it is probable that a \\nloss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. We also perform an assessment of the materiality of loss \\ncontingencies where a loss is either reasonably possible or it is reasonably possible that a loss could be incurred in excess of \\n47', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 48}), Document(page_content='am\\nounts accrued. If a loss or an additional loss has at least a reasonable possibility of occurring and the impact on the financial \\nstatements would be material, we provide disclosure of the loss contingency in the footnotes to our financial statements. We \\nreview all contingencies at least quarterly to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a \\nreasonable estimate of the loss or the range of the loss can be made.  Although we are not able to predict the outcome or \\nreasonably estimate a range of possible losses in certain matters described in Note 10  t\\no our Consolidated Financial Statements \\nand have not recorded an associated accrual related to these matters, an adverse judgment or negotiated resolution in any of \\nthese matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations or cash \\nflows.\\nIncome Taxes\\nIncome taxes have a significant effect on our net earnings.  We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign \\njurisdictions.  Accordingly, the determination of our provision for income taxes requires judgment, the use of estimates in \\ncertain cases and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws.  Our effective income tax rate is affected by many \\nfactors, including changes in our assessment of unrecognized tax benefits, increases and decreases in valuation allowances, \\nchanges in tax law, outcomes of administrative audits, the impact of discrete items and the mix of earnings among our U.S. and \\ninternational operations where the statutory rates are generally higher than the U.S. statutory rate, and may fluctuate as a result.\\nOur tax returns are routinely audited and settlements of issues raised in these audits sometimes affect our tax provisions.  The \\nbenefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in our financial statements only after determining a more likely than not \\nprobability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.  When facts and \\ncircumstances change, we reassess these probabilities and record any changes in the financial statements as appropriate.  We \\naccount for uncertain tax positions by determining the minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet \\nbefore being recognized in the financial statements.  This determination requires the use of judgment in evaluating our tax \\npositions and assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items.\\nDeferred tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years.  Such assets \\narise because of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, as well as from net \\noperating loss and tax credit carryforwards.  Deferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation \\nallowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized.  Many factors are considered when assessing \\nwhether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations \\nof future taxable income, carryforward periods and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors.  The recoverability of the \\ndeferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal \\nof taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. This evaluation relies on \\nestimates.\\nAs guidance is issued by the U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies, any resulting changes to our \\nestimates will be treated in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance. \\nITEM 7A.QUANT\\nITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\\nMar\\nket Risk\\nIn addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates, \\ncurrency exchange rates and the fair values of certain equity and equity method investments measured on a recurring basis.\\nThe analysis presented below for each of our market risk sensitive instruments is based on a hypothetical scenario used to \\ncalibrate potential risk and does not represent our view of future market changes.  The effect of a change in a particular \\nassumption is calculated without adjusting any other assumption.  In reality, however, a change in one factor could cause a \\nchange in another, which may magnify or negate other sensitivities.\\nInterest Rate Risk\\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our short-term borrowings and long-term debt.  We hedge a portion of \\nour interest rate risk by managing the mix of fixed and variable rate debt and by entering into interest rate swaps.  For fiscal \\n2023, the net fair value of our interest rate swaps decreased $0.6 billion primarily due to fluctuations in market interest rates. \\nThe table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.  For long-\\nterm debt, the table represents the principal cash flows and related weighted-average interest rates by expected maturity dates.  \\nFor interest rate swaps, the table represents the contractual cash flows and weighted-average interest rates by the contractual \\nmaturity date, unless otherwise noted.  The notional amounts are used to calculate contractual cash flows to be exchanged under \\nthe contracts.  The weighted-average variable rates are based upon prevailing market rates as of January 31, 2023.\\n48', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 49}), Document(page_content='Exp\\nected Maturity Date\\n(Amounts in millions) Fiscal 2024 Fiscal 2025 Fiscal 2026 Fiscal 2027 Fiscal 2028 Thereafter Total\\nLiabilities\\nShort-term borrowings:\\nVariable rate $ 372 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 372 \\nWeighted-average interest rate  6.6 %  — %  — %  — %  — %  — %  6.6 %\\nLong-term debt(1):\\nFixed rate $ 4,191 $ 3,516 $ 2,604 $ 2,737 $ 1,817 $ 23,975 $ 38,840 \\nWeighted-average interest rate  3.2 %  2.9 %  3.8 %  2.0 %  3.5 %  4.3 %  3.8 %\\nInterest rate derivatives\\nInterest rate swaps:\\nFixed to variable $ 1,750 $ 1,500 $ — $ — $ — $ 4,771 $ 8,021 \\nWeighted-average pay rate  5.2 %  5.9 %  — %  — %  — %  5.8 %  5.7 %\\nWeighted-average receive rate  2.6 %  3.3 %  — %  — %  — %  2.5 %  2.7 %\\n(1)Includes deferred loan costs, discounts, fair value hedges, for\\neign-held debt and secured debt. \\nAs of January 31, 2023, our variable rate borrowings, including the effect of our commercial paper and interest rate swaps, \\nrepresented 21% of our total short-term and long-term debt.  Based on January 31, 2023 debt levels, a 100 basis point change in \\nprevailing market rates would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately $0.1 billion.\\nForeign Currency Risk\\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates as a result of our investments and operations in countries other than \\nthe U.S., as well as our foreign-currency-denominated long-term debt.  For fiscal 2023, movements in currency exchange rates \\nand the related impact on the translation of the balance sheets resulted in the $1.1 billion net loss in the currency translation and \\nother category of accumulated other comprehensive loss.  \\nWe hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk by entering into currency swaps.  The aggregate fair value of these swaps was \\nin a liability position of $1.4 billion and $1.0 billion as of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, respectively.  The change in \\nthe fair value of these swaps was due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. \\ndollar relative to certain currencies in fiscal 2023.  The hypothetical result of a uniform 10% weakening in the value of the U.S. \\ndollar relative to other currencies underlying these swaps would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $0.7 \\nbillion.  A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates underlying these swaps from the market rates in effect as of January 31, \\n2023 would have resulted in a change in the value of the swaps of $0.1 billion.\\nIn certain countries, we also enter into immaterial foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase and payment of \\npurchase commitments denominated in non-functional currencies.\\nInvestment Risk\\nWe are exposed to investment risk primarily related to changes in the fair value of equity securities, as well as certain \\nimmaterial equity method investments where we have elected the fair value option measured on a recurring basis.  These \\nchanges in fair value are recorded within other gains and losses and resulted in a loss of $1.7 billion in fiscal 2023 primarily due \\nto net decreases in the underlying stock prices of those investments.  As of January 31, 2023, the fair value of our equity \\ninvestments, including certain equity method investments, measured on a recurring basis was $10.7 billion.  As of January 31, \\n2023, a hypothetical 10% change in the stock price of such investments would have changed the fair value of such investments \\nby approximately $1.1 billion. \\n49', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 50}), Document(page_content=\"IT\\nEM 8.

In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial \\nposition of the Company at January 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three \\nyears in the period ended January 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) \\n(PCAOB), the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, based on criteria established in \\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission \\n(2013 framework) and our report dated March 17, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\\nBasis for Opinion \\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\\'s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on \\nthe Company\\'s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are \\nrequired to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable \\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the \\naudit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to \\nerror or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial \\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included \\nexamining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included \\nevaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall \\npresentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\\nCritical Audit Matter\\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that \\nwas communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that \\nare material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The \\ncommunication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements, \\ntaken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical \\naudit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\\nContingencies\\nDescription of \\nthe MatterAs described in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, at January 31, 2023, the Company is \\ninvolved in a number of legal proceedings and regulatory matters.  The Company records a liability for \\nthose legal proceedings and regulatory matters when management determines it is probable that a loss \\nhas been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.  The Company also discloses \\nwhen it is reasonably possible that a material loss may be incurred.  In assessing the probability of \\noccurrence and whether an estimate of loss can be reasonably estimated for a particular legal proceeding, \\nmanagement exercises judgment on matters relevant to each proceeding, such as whether sufficient \\nparticipation in settlement proceedings will occur, or whether it can predict the number of claims that \\nmay be filed.  For example, management exercised judgment in accruing a liability for approximately \\n$3.3 billion for the Settlement Framework and other previously agreed state and tribal settlements \\nregarding opioid-related lawsuits. Auditing management\\'s accounting for, and disclosure of, loss \\ncontingencies was complex and highly judgmental as it involved our assessment of the significant \\njudgments made by management when assessing the probability of occurrence for contingencies or when \\ndetermining whether an estimate of the loss or range of loss could be made. \\n51', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 52}), Document(page_content=\"How W\\ne \\nAddressed the \\nMatter in Our \\nAuditWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls \\nover the identification and evaluation of contingencies.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial \\nreporting based on our audit.

We believe that our audit provides a \\nreasonable basis for our opinion. \\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting \\nA company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the \\nreliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally \\naccepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures \\nthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and \\ndispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit \\npreparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and \\nexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the \\ncompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or \\ndisposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. \\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, \\nprojections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate \\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP \\nRogers, Arkansas\\nMarch 17, 2023\\n53\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\\nGeneral\\nWalmart Inc. (\"Walmart\" or the \"Company\") people-led, technology-powered omni-channel retailer dedicated to help people \\naround the world save money and live better – anytime and anywhere – by providing the opportunity to shop in both retail \\nstores and through eCommerce.  Through innovation, the Company is striving to continuously improve a customer-centric \\nexperience that seamlessly integrates eCommerce and retail stores in an omni-channel offering that saves time for its customers.  \\nThe Company\\'s operations comprise three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam\\'s Club.\\nPrinciples of Consolidation\\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Walmart and its subsidiaries as of and for the fiscal years ended \\nJanuary 31, 2023 (\"fiscal 2023\"), January 31, 2022 (\"fiscal 2022\") and January 31, 2021 (\"fiscal 2021\").  Intercompany \\naccounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  The Company consolidates variable interest entities where it \\nhas been determined that the Company is the primary beneficiary of those entities\\' operations.  Investments in common stock or \\nin-substance common stock for which the Company exercises significant influence but does not have control are accounted for \\nunder the equity method.  These variable interest entities and equity method investments are immaterial to the Company\\'s \\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\\nThe Company\\'s Consolidated Financial Statements are based on a fiscal year ending on January 31 for the United States \\n(\"U.S.\") and Canadian operations.  The Company consolidates all other operations generally using a one-month lag and based \\non a calendar year.  There were no significant intervening events during the month of January 2023 related to the operations \\nconsolidated using a lag that materially affected the Consolidated Financial Statements.\\nUse of Estimates\\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  \\nThose principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and \\nliabilities.  Management\\'s estimates and assumptions also affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of \\nthe financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results may \\ndiffer from those estimates.\\nCash and Cash Equivalents\\nThe Company considers investments with a maturity when purchased of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  All credit \\ncard, debit card and electronic transfer transactions that process in less than seven days are classified as cash and cash \\nequivalents.  The amounts due from banks for these transactions classified as cash and cash equivalents totaled $2.0 billion and \\n$1.7 billion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. \\nThe Company\\'s cash balances are held in various locations around the world.  Of the Company\\'s $8.6 billion and $14.8 billion \\nin cash and cash equivalents as of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, approximately 62% and 50% were held outside of \\nthe U.S., respectively.  Cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. are generally utilized to support liquidity needs in the \\nCompany\\'s non-U.S. operations.\\nThe Company uses intercompany financing arrangements in an effort to ensure cash can be made available in the country in \\nwhich it is needed with the minimum cost possible. \\nAs of January 31, 2023 and 2022, cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.9 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively, may \\nnot be freely transferable to the U.S. due to local laws, other restrictions or are subject to the approval of the noncontrolling \\ninterest shareholders.\\nReceivables\\nReceivables are stated at their carrying values, net of a reserve for doubtful accounts, and are primarily due from the following: \\ncustomers, which includes pharmacy insurance companies as well as advertisers, and banks for customer credit, debit cards and \\nelectronic transfer transactions that take in excess of seven days to process; suppliers for marketing or incentive programs; \\ngovernments for income taxes; and real estate transactions.  As of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, net receivables from \\ntransactions with customers were $3.7 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively.\\n59', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 60}), Document(page_content='Inv\\nentories\\nThe Company utilizes various inventory methods to account for and value its inventories depending upon the nature of the store \\nformats and businesses in each of its segments, resulting in inventories that are recorded at the lower of cost or market or net \\nrealizable value, as appropriate.  \\n• Walmart U.S. Segment - Inventories are primarily accounted for under the retail inventory method of accounting \\n(\"RIM\") to determine inventory cost, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") valuation method.  RIM generally results in \\ninventory being valued at the lower of cost or market as permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a \\nreduction of the retail value of inventory.\\n• Walmart International Segment – Depending on the store format in each market, inventories are generally accounted \\nfor using either the RIM or weighted-average cost method, using the first-in, first-out valuation method. \\n• Sam\\'s Club Segment - The majority of this segment\\'s inventory is accounted for and valued using the weighted-\\naverage cost LIFO method.\\nFor those segments that utilize the LIFO method, the Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the \\nprojected annual effect of inflation or deflation.  These estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end for \\ninflation or deflation and inventory levels. \\nProperty and Equipment\\nProperty and equipment are initially recorded at cost.  Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred.  \\nCosts of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.  The \\nfollowing table summarizes the Company\\'s property and equipment balances and includes the estimated useful lives that are \\ngenerally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis:\\nEstimated\\n Useful Lives As of January 31,\\n(Dollars in millions) (in Years) 2023 2022\\nLand N/A $ 19,317 $ 19,204 \\nBuildings and improvements 3 - 40  104,554  100,376 \\nFixtures and equipment 2 - 30  65,235  60,282 \\nTransportation equipment 3 - 15  2,462  2,263 \\nConstruction in progress N/A  10,802  7,199 \\nProperty and equipment  202,370  189,324 \\nAccumulated depreciation  (101,610)  (94,809) \\nProperty and equipment, net $ 100,760 $ 94,515 \\nLe\\nasehold improvements are depreciated or amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining \\nexpected lease term.  Total depreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment, property under finance leases \\nand intangible assets for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $10.9 billion, $10.7 billion and $11.2 billion, respectively.\\nLeases\\nFor any new or modified lease, the Company, at the inception of the contract, determines whether a contract is or contains a \\nlease.  The Company records right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and lease obligations for its finance and operating leases, which are \\ninitially recognized based on the discounted future lease payments over the term of the lease.  If the rate implicit in the \\nCompany\\'s leases is not readily determinable, the Company\\'s applicable incremental borrowing rate is used in calculating the \\npresent value of the sum of the lease payments.\\nLease term is defined as the non-cancelable period of the lease plus any options to extend or terminate the lease when it is \\nreasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option. The Company has elected not to recognize ROU asset and lease \\nobligations for its short-term leases, which are defined as leases with an initial term of 12 months or less.\\nFor a majority of all classes of underlying assets, the Company has elected to not separate lease from non-lease components. \\nFor leases in which the lease and non-lease components have been combined, the variable lease expense includes expenses such \\nas common area maintenance, utilities, and repairs and maintenance.\\n60', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 61}), Document(page_content=\"Im\\npairment of Long-Lived Assets\\nManagement reviews long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that \\nthe carrying amount may not be recoverable.  The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which \\nis at the individual store or club level.  Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated \\nover the assets' useful lives based on updated projections.  If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the assets may \\nnot be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as \\ndetermined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. \\nGoodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets \\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations and is \\nallocated to the appropriate reporting unit when acquired.  Other acquired intangible assets are stated at the fair value acquired \\nas determined by a valuation technique commensurate with the intended use of the related asset.  Goodwill and indefinite-lived \\nintangible assets are not amortized; rather, they are evaluated for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in \\ncircumstances indicate that the value of the asset may be impaired.  Definite-lived intangible assets are considered long-lived \\nassets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the periods that expected economic benefits will be provided.\\nGoodwill is typically assigned to the reporting unit which consolidates the acquisition.  Components within the same reportable \\nsegment are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics.  As of \\nJanuary 31, 2023, the Company's reporting units consisted of Walmart U.S., Walmart International and Sam's Club.  Goodwill \\nand other indefinite-lived acquired intangible assets are evaluated for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative \\napproach for each of the Company's reporting units.  Generally, a qualitative assessment is first performed to determine whether \\na quantitative goodwill impairment test is necessary.  If management determines, after performing an assessment based on the \\nqualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not less than the carrying amount, or that a fair \\nvalue of the reporting unit substantially in excess of the carrying amount cannot be assured, then a quantitative goodwill \\nimpairment test would be required.  The quantitative test for goodwill impairment is performed by determining the fair value of \\nthe related reporting units.  Fair value is measured based on the discounted cash flow method and relative market-based \\napproaches.  Management has performed its evaluation and determined the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly \\ngreater than the carrying amount and, accordingly, the Company has not recorded any impairment charges related to goodwill.\\nThe following table reflects goodwill activity, by reportable segment, for fiscal 2023 and 2022:\\n(A\\nmounts in millions) Walmart U.S.Walmart\\nInternational Sam's Club Total\\nBalances as of February 1, 2021 $ 2,696 $ 25,966 $ 321 $ 28,983 \\nChanges in currency translation and other  —  (415)  —  (415) \\nAcquisitions  245  201  —  446 \\nBalances as of January 31, 2022  2,941  25,752  321  29,014 \\nChanges in currency translation and other  —  (1,475)  —  (1,475) \\nAcquisitions  433  202  —  635 \\nBalances as of January 31, 2023 $ 3,374 $ 24,479 $ 321 $ 28,174 \\nInt\\nangible assets are recorded in other long-term assets in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  As of January 31, 2023 \\nand 2022, the Company had $4.3 billion and $4.8 billion, respectively, in indefinite-lived intangible assets which primarily \\nconsists of acquired trade names.  There were no significant impairment charges related to intangible assets for fiscal 2023, \\n2022 or 2021.  \\nFair Value Measurement\\nThe Company records and discloses certain financial and non-financial assets and liabilities at fair value.  The fair value of an \\nasset is the price at which the asset could be sold in an orderly transaction between unrelated, knowledgeable and willing parties \\nable to engage in the transaction.  The fair value of a liability is the amount that would be paid to transfer the liability to a new \\nobligor in a transaction between such parties, not the amount that would be paid to settle the liability with the creditor.  Refer to \\nNote 8  for m\\nore information. \\nInvestments\\nInvestments in equity securities are recorded in other long-term assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Changes in fair \\nvalue of equity securities, as well as certain immaterial equity method investments where the Company has elected the fair \\nvalue option measured on a recurring basis, are recognized within other gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of \\nIncome.  These fair value changes, along with certain other immaterial investment activity, resulted in net losses of $1.7 billion \\nand $2.4 billion for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022, respectively and net gains of $8.6 billion in fiscal 2021, primarily due to net \\nchanges in the underlying stock prices of those investments.

Equity investments without readily \\n61\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 62}), Document(page_content='de\\nterminable fair values are carried at cost and adjusted for any observable price changes or impairments within other gains and \\nlosses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  \\nInvestments in debt securities classified as trading are reported at fair value and adjustments in fair value are recorded within \\nother gains and losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  As of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, the Company \\nhad $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion, respectively, in debt securities classified as trading.\\nIndemnification Liabilities\\nThe Company has provided certain indemnifications in connection with its divestitures and has recorded indemnification \\nliabilities equal to the estimated fair value of the obligations upon inception.  As of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, the \\nCompany had $0.6 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively, of certain legal indemnification liabilities recorded within deferred \\nincome taxes and other in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The maximum of potential future payments under these \\nindemnities was $3.1 billion, based on exchange rates as of January 31, 2023. \\nSelf Insurance Reserves\\nThe Company self-insures a number of risks, including, but not limited to, workers\\' compensation, general liability, auto \\nliability, product liability and certain employee-related healthcare benefits.  Standard actuarial procedures and data analysis are \\nused to estimate the liabilities associated with these risks on an undiscounted basis.  The recorded liabilities reflect the ultimate \\ncost for claims incurred but not paid and any estimable administrative run-out expenses related to the processing of these \\noutstanding claim payments.  On a regular basis, the liabilities are evaluated for appropriateness with claims reserve valuations.  \\nTo limit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions, including stop-\\nloss insurance coverage for workers\\' compensation, general liability and auto liability.\\nDerivatives\\nThe Company uses derivatives for hedging purposes to manage its exposure to changes in interest and currency exchange rates, \\nas well as to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed- and variable-rate debt.  Use of derivatives in hedging programs subjects the \\nCompany to certain risks, such as market and credit risks.  The Company may be exposed to credit-related losses in the event of \\nnonperformance by its counterparties to derivatives.  Credit risk is monitored through established approval procedures, \\nincluding setting concentration limits by counterparty, reviewing credit ratings and requiring collateral from the counterparty.  \\nThe Company enters into derivatives with counterparties rated generally \"A-\" or better by nationally recognized credit rating \\nagencies. The Company is subject to master netting arrangements which provides set-off and close-out netting of exposures \\nwith counterparties, but the Company does not offset derivative assets and liabilities in its Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The \\nCompany\\'s collateral arrangements require the counterparty in a net liability position in excess of pre-determined thresholds, \\nafter considering the effects of netting arrangements, to pledge cash collateral. Cash collateral received from counterparties and \\ncash collateral provided to counterparties under these arrangements wa\\ns not significant  as of Ja\\nnuary 31, 2023 and 2022.\\nIn order to qualify for hedge accounting, at the inception of the hedging relationship, the Company formally documents its risk \\nmanagement objective and strategy for undertaking the hedging transaction, as well as its designation of the hedge.  If a \\nderivative is recorded using hedge accounting, depending on the nature of the hedge, derivative gains and losses are recorded \\nthrough the same financial statement line item in earnings or are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the \\nhedged item is recognized in earnings.  Derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting, or contracts for which the \\nCompany has not elected hedge accounting, are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported in earnings.  \\nDerivatives with an unrealized gain are recorded in the Company\\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets as either current or non-current \\nassets, based on maturity date, and derivatives with an unrealized loss are recorded as either current or non-current liabilities, \\nbased on maturity date.  Refer to Note 8  for t\\nhe presentation of the Company\\'s derivative assets and liabilities. \\nFair Value Hedges\\nThe Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps that the Company uses to hedge the fair value \\nof fixed-rate debt.  All interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of the related long-term debt meet the shortcut \\nmethod requirements under U.S. GAAP.  Accordingly, changes in the fair values of these interest rate swaps are considered to \\nexactly offset changes in the fair value of the underlying long-term debt.  These derivatives will mature on dates ranging from \\nApril 2023 to September 2031.\\nCash Flow Hedges\\nThe Company is a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency \\nexposure associated with the forecasted payments of principal and interest of certain non-U.S. denominated debt.  The \\nCompany records changes in the fair value of these swaps in accumulated other comprehensive loss which is subsequently \\nreclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.  These derivatives will mature on \\ndates ranging from July 2024 to January 2039.\\n62', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 63}), Document(page_content='Ne\\nt Investment Hedges\\nPrior to the divestiture of the Company\\'s operations in the United Kingdom and Japan as discussed in Note 12 , t\\nhe Company \\nwas a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure \\nassociated with net investments of these foreign operations.  Changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk were recorded \\nin accumulated other comprehensive loss.  The Company also previously designated certain foreign currency denominated \\nlong-term debt as a hedge of currency exposure associated with the net investment of these divested operations and recorded \\nforeign currency gain or loss associated with designated long-term debt in accumulated other comprehensive loss.  Upon \\nclosing of the sale of the Company\\'s operations in the U.K. and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, these amounts were \\nreleased from accumulated other comprehensive loss as discussed in Note 4 .  \\nInc\\nome Taxes\\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the \\nestimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing \\nassets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (\"temporary differences\").  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured \\nusing enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  The \\neffect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the \\nenactment date.\\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not \\nmore likely than not to be realized.  Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the \\ndeferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward \\nperiods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors.  The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by \\nassessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, \\nforecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies.  These sources of income rely on estimates.\\nIn determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent \\ndifferences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates.  Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes \\nin tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\\nThe Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be \\ntaken in a tax return.  The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and \\noperating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Company\\'s Consolidated Statements of Income.  \\nRefer to Note 9  for a\\ndditional income tax disclosures.\\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\\nNoncontrolling interests that are redeemable outside the Company\\'s control at fixed or determinable prices and dates are \\npresented as temporary equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Redeemable noncontrolling interests are \\nrecorded at the greater of the redemption fair value or the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest and adjusted each \\nreporting period for income, loss and any distributions made. Remeasurements to the redemption value of the redeemable \\nnoncontrolling interest are recognized in capital in excess of par.  As of January 31, 2023, the Company has a redeemable \\nnoncontrolling interest related to an acquisition in the Walmart U.S. segment as the minority interest owner holds a put option \\nwhich may require the Company to purchase its interest beginning in December 2027 with annual options thereafter.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nNet Sales\\nThe Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise or \\nservices to the customer.  eCommerce sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer.  \\nEstimated sales returns are calculated based on expected returns.\\nMembership Fee Revenue\\nThe Company recognizes membership fee revenue over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months.  \\nMembership fee revenue was $2.6 billion for fiscal 2023, $2.2 billion for fiscal 2022 and $1.7 billion for fiscal 2021.  \\nMembership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in the Company\\'s Consolidated Statements of Income.  \\nDeferred membership fee revenue is included in accrued liabilities in the Company\\'s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\n63', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 64}), Document(page_content=\"Gi\\nft Cards\\nCustomer purchases of gift cards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise \\nusing the gift card.  Gift cards in the U.S. and some countries do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members \\ncan redeem their gift cards for merchandise and services indefinitely.  Gift cards in some countries where the Company does \\nbusiness have expiration dates.  While gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months, a certain number of gift cards, both \\nwith and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed.  Management estimates unredeemed balances and recognizes \\nrevenue for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income over the \\nexpected redemption period. \\nFinancial, Advertising and Other Services\\nThe Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed.  Generally, revenue from \\nservices is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.\\nCost of Sales\\nCost of sales includes actual product cost, the cost of transportation to the Company's distribution facilities, stores and clubs \\nfrom suppliers, the cost of transportation from the Company's distribution facilities to the stores, clubs and customers and the \\ncost of warehousing for the Sam's Club segment and import distribution centers.  Cost of sales is reduced by supplier payments \\nthat are not a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs.\\nPayments from Suppliers\\nThe Company receives consideration from suppliers for various programs, primarily volume incentives, warehouse allowances \\nand reimbursements for specific programs such as markdowns, margin protection, certain advertising arrangements and \\nsupplier-specific fixtures.  Payments from suppliers are accounted for as a reduction of cost of sales, except in certain limited \\nsituations when the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs, and are recognized in the \\nCompany's Consolidated Statements of Income when the related inventory is sold.\\nOperating, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses\\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs of the Company, except cost of sales, as \\ndescribed above.  As a result, the majority of the cost of warehousing and occupancy for the Walmart U.S. and Walmart \\nInternational segments' distribution facilities is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses.  Because the \\nCompany only includes a portion of the cost of its Walmart U.S. and Walmart International segments' distribution facilities in \\ncost of sales, its gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales may not be comparable to those of other retailers that \\nmay include all costs related to their distribution facilities in cost of sales and in the calculation of gross profit.\\nAdvertising Costs\\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred, consist primarily of digital, television and print advertisements and are recorded in \\noperating, selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Advertising costs \\nwere $4.1 billion, $3.9 billion and $3.2 billion for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\\nCurrency Translation\\nThe assets and liabilities of all international subsidiaries are translated from the respective local currency to the U.S. dollar \\nusing exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  Related translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated \\nother comprehensive loss.  The Company's Consolidated Statements of Income of all international subsidiaries are translated \\nfrom the respective local currencies to the U.S. dollar using average exchange rates for the period covered by the income \\nstatements.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of \\nSupplier Finance Program Obligations, which enhances the transparency about the use of supplier finance programs for \\ninvestors and other allocators of capital. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, \\nincluding interim periods within those fiscal years, except for the disclosure of rollforward information, which is effective for \\nfiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied retrospectively \\nto each period in which a balance sheet is presented, except for disclosure of rollforward information, which should be applied \\nprospectively. Management is currently evaluating this ASU to determine its impact on the Company's disclosures.\\n64\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 65}), Document(page_content='Note\\n 2.

The Company believes that such awards serve to align the interests of its associates with \\nthose of its shareholders.\\nThe Plan's award types are summarized as follows:\\n•Restricted Stock Units.  Restricted stock units provide rights to Company stock after a specified service period.  \\nBeginning in fiscal 2023, restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of 8% each quarter over a three year period from \\nthe date of grant.  For grants made from fiscal 2020 through fiscal 2022, restricted stock units generally vest at a rate of \\n25% each year over a four year period from the date of the grant.  Prior to fiscal 2020, 50% of restricted stock units \\ngenerally vested three years from the grant date and the remaining 50% were vested five years from the grant date.  The \\nfair value of each restricted stock unit is determined on the date of grant using the stock price discounted for the \\nexpected dividend yield through the vesting period and is recognized ratably over the vesting period.  The expected \\ndividend yield is based on the anticipated dividends over the vesting period.  The weighted-average discount for the \\ndividend yield used to determine the fair value of restricted stock units granted in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was 2.3%, \\n3.8% and 4.4%, respectively.\\n• Restricted Stock and Performance-based Restricted Stock Units.  Restricted stock awards are for shares that vest based \\non the passage of time and include restrictions related to employment.  Performance-based restricted stock units vest \\nbased on the passage of time and achievement of performance criteria and generally range from 0% to 150% of the \\noriginal award amount.  Vesting periods for restricted stock are generally between one month and three years.  Vesting \\nperiods for performance-based restricted stock units are generally between one and three years.  Restricted stock and \\nperformance-based restricted stock units may be settled or deferred in stock and are accounted for as equity in the \\nCompany's Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The fair value of restricted stock awards is determined on the date of grant \\nand is expensed ratably over the vesting period.  The fair value of performance-based restricted stock units is \\ndetermined on the date of grant using the Company's stock price discounted for the expected dividend yield through the \\nvesting period and is recognized over the vesting period.  The weighted-average discount for the dividend yield used to \\ndetermine the fair value of performance-based restricted stock units in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 was 3.3%, 4.2% and \\n4.5%, respectively.\\nIn addition to the Plan, Flipkart and PhonePe have share-based compensation plans for associates under which options to \\nacquire their own common shares may be issued.  These plans may be subject to performance or other conditions, including \\nvesting upon an initial public offering. Share-based compensation expense associated with certain of these plans is included in \\nthe Other line in the table above. \\nThe following table shows the activity for restricted stock units and restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock \\nunits during fiscal 2023:\\nRestricted\\n Stock UnitsRestricted Stock and \\nPerformance-based Restricted Stock \\nUnits\\n(Shares in thousands) SharesWeighted-Average \\nGrant-Date Fair \\nValue Per Share SharesWeighted-Average \\nGrant-Date Fair \\nValue Per Share\\nOutstanding as of February 1, 2022  17,283 $ 111.42  6,140 $ 125.25 \\nGranted  9,357  143.97  4,572  142.74 \\nAdjustment for performance achievement(1) —  —  638  132.00 \\nVested/exercised  (8,338)  111.69  (3,242)  120.18 \\nForfeited  (2,082)  127.36  (948)  128.68 \\nOutstanding as of January 31, 2023  16,220 $ 128.01  7,160 $ 138.86 \\n(1)  Represents the adjustment to previously granted performance s\\nhare units for performance achievement. \\nThe following table includes additional information related to restricted stock units and restricted stock and performance-based \\nrestricted stock units:  \\n Fiscal Years En\\nded January 31,\\n(Amounts in millions, except years) 2023 2022 2021\\nFair value of restricted stock units vested $ 931 $ 703 $ 597 \\nFair value of restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units vested  390  264  275 \\nUnrecognized compensation cost for restricted stock units  1,323  1,102  1,062 \\nUnrecognized compensation cost for restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock units  548  417  344 \\nWeighted average remaining period to expense for restricted stock units (years) 1.0 1.2 1.1\\nWeighted average remaining period to expense for restricted stock and performance-based restricted stock \\nunits (years)1.4 1.5 1.4\\n66\", metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 67}), Document(page_content=\"Share\\n Repurchase Program\\nFrom time to time, the Company repurchases shares of its common stock under share repurchase programs authorized by the \\nCompany's Board of Directors.

Fair Value Measurements\\nAssets and liabilities recorded at fair value are measured using the fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in \\nmeasuring fair value.  The levels of the fair value hierarchy are:\\n• Level 1: observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\\n• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable; and\\n• Level 3: unobservable inputs for which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring the Company to develop \\nits own assumptions.\\nAs described in Note 1 , t\\nhe Company measures the fair value of certain equity investments, including certain equity method \\ninvestments, on a recurring basis in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Derivative fair values are the estimated amounts the Company would \\nreceive or pay upon termination of the related derivative agreements as of the reporting dates.

As of January 31, 2023 and January 31, 2022, the notional amounts and fair values of these derivatives were as follows:\\n Jan\\nuary 31, 2023 January 31, 2022\\n(Amounts in millions)Notional \\nAmount Fair ValueNotional \\nAmount Fair Value\\nReceive fixed-rate, pay variable-rate interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges $ 8,021 $ (689) (1)$ 8,021 $ (47) (1)\\nReceive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross-currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges  5,900  (1,423) (1) 7,855  (1,048) (1)\\nTotal $ 13,921 $ (2,112) $ 15,876 $ (1,095) \\n(1)P\\nrimarily classified in deferred income taxes and other in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\\nNonrecurring Fair Value Measurements\\nIn addition to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, the Company's assets and liabilities are \\nalso subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements.  Generally, assets are recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as a \\nresult of impairment charges.  \\nUpon completing the sales of the Company's operations in the U.K. in February 2021 and Japan in March 2021, the Company \\nrecorded incremental non-recurring impairment charges of $0.4 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 within other gains and \\nlosses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.  Refer to Note 12 . T\\nhe Company did not have any material assets or liabilities \\nresulting in nonrecurring fair value measurements as of January 31, 2023. \\nFor the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, the Company's operations in Argentina, Japan and the U.K. met the held for sale \\ncriteria in fiscal 2021, as further discussed in Note 12 .  As a\\n result, the individual disposal groups were measured at fair value, \\nless costs to sell, which is considered a Level 3 fair value measurement based on each transaction's expected consideration. The \\ncarrying value of the Argentina, Japan and U.K. disposal groups exceeded their fair value, less costs to sell, and as a result, the \\nCompany recognized non-recurring impairment charges.  The aggregate pre-tax loss of $8.3 billion associated with the \\ndivestiture of these operations in the Walmart International segment was recorded in other gains and losses in the Consolidated \\nStatements of Income for the year ended January 31, 2021, and included these impairment charges as well as a $2.3 billion \\ncharge related to the Asda pension plan.  These impairment charges included the anticipated release of non-cash cumulative \\nforeign currency translation losses associated with the disposal groups. Other impairment charges for assets measured at fair \\nvalue on a nonrecurring basis during fiscal 2021 were immaterial.\\nOther Fair Value Disclosures\\nThe Company records cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term borrowings at cost.  The carrying values of \\nthese instruments approximate their fair value due to their short-term maturities.\\nThe Company's long-term debt is also recorded at cost.  The fair value is estimated using Level 2 inputs based on the \\nCompany's current incremental borrowing rate for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

As a result of the Tax Act, the Company reported and paid U.S. tax on the \\nmajority of its previously unremitted foreign earnings, and repatriations of foreign earnings will generally be free of U.S. \\nfederal tax, but may incur other taxes such as withholding or state taxes.  As of January 31, 2023, the Company has not \\nrecorded approximately $3 billion of deferred tax liabilities associated with remaining unremitted foreign earnings considered \\nindefinitely reinvested, for which U.S. and foreign income and withholding taxes would be due upon repatriation.\\nNet Operating Losses, Tax Credit Carryforwards and Valuation Allowances\\nAs of January 31, 2023, the Company\\'s net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards totaled approximately $32.3 billion.  \\nOf these carryforwards, approximately $19.6 billion will expire, if not utilized, in various years through 2043.  The remaining \\ncarryforwards have no expiration. \\nThe realizability of these future tax deductions and credits is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable \\nincome from all sources, including taxable income in prior carryback years, reversal of taxable temporary differences, \\nforecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies.  To the extent the Company does not consider it more likely \\nthan not that a deferred tax asset will be recovered, a valuation allowance is generally established.  To the extent that a \\nvaluation allowance was established and it is subsequently determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets \\nwill be recovered, the change in the valuation allowance is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\\nThe Company had valuation allowances of approximately $7.8 billion and $9.5 billion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, \\nrespectively, on deferred tax assets associated primarily with the net operating loss carryforwards. Activity in the valuation \\nallowance during fiscal 2023 related to valuation allowance builds in multiple markets, as well as releases due to the expiration \\nof unrealized deferred tax assets.\\nUncertain Tax Positions\\nThe benefits of uncertain tax positions are recorded in the Company\\'s Consolidated Financial Statements only after determining \\na more-likely-than-not probability that the uncertain tax positions will withstand challenge, if any, from taxing authorities.\\nAs of January 31, 2023 and 2022, the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits related to continuing operations was $3.3 \\nbillion and $3.2 billion, respectively.  The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company\\'s effective \\nincome tax rate was $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\\nA reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations is as follows:\\n Fiscal Years En\\nded January 31,\\n(Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021\\nGross unrecognized tax benefits, beginning of year $ 3,245 $ 3,135 $ 1,817 \\nIncreases related to prior year tax positions  79  170  92 \\nDecreases related to prior year tax positions  (248)  (97)  (264) \\nIncreases related to current year tax positions  357  75  1,582 \\nSettlements during the period  (89)  (5)  (64) \\nLapse in statutes of limitations  (37)  (33)  (28) \\nGross unrecognized tax benefits, end of year $ 3,307 $ 3,245 $ 3,135 \\nThe\\n Company classifies interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as interest expense and as operating, selling, \\ngeneral and administrative expenses, respectively.

During the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that tax audit resolutions could reduce \\nunrecognized tax benefits by an immaterial amount, either because the tax positions are sustained on audit or because the \\nCompany agrees to their disallowance.  The Company does not expect any change to have a material impact to its Consolidated \\nFinancial Statements.\\n74', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 75}), Document(page_content='The\\n Company remains subject to income tax examinations for its U.S. federal income taxes generally for fiscal 2018 through \\n2022.

With few exceptions, \\nthe Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before fiscal \\n2013.\\nOther Taxes\\nThe Company is subject to tax examinations for value added, sales-based, payroll and other non-income taxes.  A number of \\nthese examinations are ongoing in various jurisdictions.  In certain cases, the Company has received assessments and judgments \\nfrom the respective taxing authorities in connection with these examinations.

Contingencies\\nLegal Proceedings\\nThe Company is involved in a number of legal proceedings and certain regulatory matters. The Company records a liability for \\nthose legal proceedings and regulatory matters when it determines it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of \\nthe loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company also discloses when it is reasonably possible that a material loss may be \\nincurred. From time to time, the Company may enter into discussions regarding settlement of these matters, and may enter into \\nsettlement agreements, if it believes settlement is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders.\\nUnless stated otherwise, the matters discussed below, if decided adversely to or settled by the Company, individually or in the \\naggregate, may result in a liability material to the Company\\'s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\\nSettlement Framework Regarding Multidistrict and State or Local Opioid Related Litigation \\nDuri\\nng fiscal 2023, the Company accrued a liability for approximately $3.3 billion for the Settlement Framework (described \\nbelow) and other previously agreed upon state and tribal settlements. Because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable \\nand unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the assessment is highly subjective and requires judgments about future \\nevents. Moreover, the Settlement Framework will only take effect once a sufficient number of political subdivisions join, and \\nthere is no assurance regarding such participation. The amount of ultimate loss may thus differ materially from this accrual. The \\nSettlement Framework includes no admission of wrongdoing or liability by the Company, and the Company continues to \\nbelieve it has substantial factual and legal defenses to opioids-related litigation.\\nIn December 2017, the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous lawsuits filed against a \\nwide array of defendants by various plaintiffs, including counties, cities, healthcare providers, Native American tribes, \\nindividuals, and third-party payers, asserting claims generally concerning the impacts of widespread opioid abuse. The \\nconsolidated multidistrict litigation is entitled In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) (the \"MDL\") and \\nis pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The Company is named as a defendant in some of the \\ncases included in the MDL. \\nSimilar cases that name the Company also have been filed in state courts by state, local, and tribal governments, healthcare \\nproviders, and other plaintiffs. Plaintiffs in these state court cases and in the MDL are seeking compensatory and punitive \\ndamages, as well as injunctive relief including abatement. The Company has also been responding to subpoenas, information \\nrequests, and investigations from governmental entities related to nationwide controlled substance dispensing and distribution \\npractices involving opioids.\\nOn November 15, 2022, the Company announced it had agreed to financial amounts and payment terms to resolve substantially \\nall opioids-related lawsuits filed against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes whether as \\npart of the MDL (excluding, however, a single, two-county trial described further below) or pending state court, as well as all \\npotential claims that could be made against the Company by states, political subdivisions, and Native American tribes for up to \\napproximately $3.1 billion (the \"Settlement Amount\"). The Settlement Amount includes amounts for remediation of alleged \\nharms as well as attorneys\\' fees and costs and also includes some, but not all, amounts from previously agreed recent \\nsettlements by the Company. One settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation thresholds applies for \\nthe states and political subdivisions, and another settlement framework with corresponding conditions and participation \\nthresholds applies for the Native American tribes. Both settlement frameworks are referred to collectively as the \"Settlement \\nFramework.\"\\nThe Settlement Framework, among other applicable conditions, provides that payments to states and political subdivisions are \\ncontingent upon the number of states and political subdivisions, including those states and political subdivisions who have not \\nyet sued the Company, that agree to participate in the Settlement Framework or otherwise have their claims foreclosed within a \\nprescribed deadline. On December 20, 2022, the Company announced that it had settlement agreements with all 50 states, \\nincluding four states that previously settled with the Company, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three other \\n75', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 76}), Document(page_content='U.S. t\\nerritories (the \"Settling States\"), thus satisfying the initial threshold of required participation by Settling States. The \\nsettlement with the Settling States is now contingent upon, among other applicable terms and conditions, a sufficient number of \\npolitical subdivisions also agreeing to participate in the Settlement Framework. \\nIf all conditions for the Settlement Framework, including, but not limited to, the minimum participation thresholds applicable \\nfor political subdivisions are satisfied within the prescribed deadlines, then the Company would expect to pay up to the full \\nportion of the Settlement Amount attributable to the Settling States, beginning as early as the second quarter of fiscal 2024 and \\nbeing completed during fiscal 2024. However, the Company cannot predict if, when, or to what extent the Settlement \\nFramework will be finalized with any of the Settling States.\\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company paid $0.4 billion for separate settlements with Cherokee Nation, New Mexico, \\nand Florida. Following these payments, the remaining $2.9 billion liability for the Settlement Framework and other settlements \\nis recorded in accrued liabilities within the Company\\'s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2023. \\nThe Settlement Framework also provides for payments to Native American tribes (excluding Cherokee Nation), contingent \\nupon the number of tribes, including those tribes that have not yet sued the Company, that agreed to participate in the \\nSettlement Framework or otherwise have their claims foreclosed within a prescribed deadline (the \"Settling Tribes\"). Pursuant \\nto the terms of the Settlement Framework, on March 3, 2023, the Company paid approximately $0.1 billion to the Settling \\nTribes in satisfaction of their claims against the Company. \\nOther Opioid Related Litigation \\nThe\\n Company will continue to vigorously defend against any opioid-related litigation not covered or otherwise extinguished by \\nthe Settlement Framework, including, but not limited to, each of the matters described below; any other actions filed by \\nhealthcare providers, individuals, and third-party payers, as well as any action filed by a state, political subdivision, or Native \\nAmerican tribe that does not agree to the Settlement Framework. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued a liability for these \\nopioid-related litigation matters nor can the Company reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these \\nmatters. The Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of any of these matters and no assurance that its \\nbusiness, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.\\nTwo-county Trial and MDL Bellwethers. The liability phase of a single, two-county trial in one of the MDL cases resulted in a \\njury verdict on November 23, 2021, finding in favor of the plaintiffs as to the liability of all defendants, including the Company. \\nThe abatement phase of the single, two-county trial resulted in a judgment on August 17, 2022, that ordered all three \\ndefendants, including the Company, to pay an aggregate amount of approximately $0.7 billion over fifteen years, on a joint and \\nseveral liability basis, and granted the plaintiffs injunctive relief. On September 7, 2022, the Company filed an appeal with the \\nSixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The monetary aspect of the judgment is stayed pending appeal, and the injunctive aspect of the \\njudgment went into effect on February 20, 2023.\\nThe MDL has designated five additional single-county cases as bellwethers to proceed through discovery; however, these five \\ncounties ultimately may elect to participate in the Settlement Framework and receive a portion of the Settlement Amount rather \\nthan go to trial. \\nDOJ Opioid Civil Litigation.  On December 22, 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") filed a civil complaint in the \\nU.S. District Court for the District of Delaware alleging that the Company unlawfully dispensed controlled substances from its \\npharmacies and unlawfully distributed controlled substances to those pharmacies. The complaint alleges that this conduct \\nresulted in violations of the Controlled Substances Act. The DOJ is seeking civil penalties and injunctive relief. The Company \\ninitially moved to dismiss the DOJ complaint on February 22, 2021. After that motion was fully briefed, the DOJ filed an \\namended complaint on October 7, 2022. On November 7, 2022, the Company filed a partial motion to dismiss the amended \\ncomplaint. That motion remains pending.\\nOpioid Related Securities Class Actions and Derivative Litigation.  In addition, the Company is the subject of two securities \\nclass actions alleging violations of the federal securities laws regarding the Company\\'s disclosures with respect to opioids, filed \\nin the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware on January 20, 2021 and March 5, 2021 purportedly on behalf of a class \\nof investors who acquired Walmart stock from March 30, 2016 through December 22, 2020. Those cases have been \\nconsolidated. On October 8, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated securities action. After the parties \\nhad fully briefed the motion to dismiss, on September 9, 2022, the Court entered an order permitting the plaintiffs to file an \\namended complaint, which was filed on October 14, 2022 and which revised the applicable putative class of investors to those \\nwho acquired Walmart stock from March 31, 2017, through December 22, 2020. On November 16, 2022, the defendants filed a \\nmotion to dismiss the amended complaint. That motion remains pending.\\nDerivative actions were also filed by two of the Company\\'s shareholders in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware \\non February 9, 2021 and April 16, 2021 alleging breach of fiduciary duties against certain of its current and former directors \\nwith respect to oversight of the Company\\'s distribution and dispensing of opioids and also alleging violations of the federal \\nsecurities laws and other breaches of duty by current directors and two current officers in connection with the Company\\'s \\nopioids disclosures.  Those cases have been stayed pending developments in other opioids litigation matters.  On September 27, \\n2021, three shareholders filed a derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery alleging that certain members of the \\n76', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 77}), Document(page_content='curre\\nnt Board and certain former officers breached their fiduciary duties in failing to adequately oversee the Company\\'s \\nprescription opioids business. The defendants moved to dismiss and/or to stay proceedings on December 21, 2021, and the \\nplaintiffs responded by filing an amended complaint on February 22, 2022. On April 20, 2022, the defendants moved to dismiss \\nand/or to stay proceedings with respect to the amended complaint. On September 26, 2022, the court held a hearing on that \\nmotion, and a ruling remains pending.\\nOther Legal Proceedings \\nAsda E\\nqual Value Claims.  Asda, formerly a subsidiary of the Company, was and still is a defendant in certain equal value \\nclaims that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester in the United Kingdom on behalf \\nof current and former Asda store employees, as well as additional claims in the High Court of the United Kingdom (the \"Asda \\nEqual Value Claims\"). Further claims may be asserted in the future. Subsequent to the divestiture of Asda in February 2021, the \\nCompany continues to oversee the conduct of the defense of these claims. While potential liability for these claims remains \\nwith Asda, the Company has agreed to provide indemnification with respect to certain of these claims up to a contractually \\ndetermined amount. The Company cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate \\nany loss or range of loss that may arise related to these proceedings. Accordingly, the Company can provide no assurance as to \\nthe scope and outcome of these matters.\\nMoney Transfer Agent Services Matters.  The Company has responded to grand jury subpoenas issued by the United States \\nAttorney\\'s Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice (the \"DOJ\") seeking \\ndocuments regarding the Company\\'s consumer fraud prevention program and anti-money laundering compliance related to the \\nCompany\\'s money transfer services, where Walmart is an agent. The most recent subpoena was issued in August 2020. The \\nCompany continues to cooperate with and provide information in response to requests from the DOJ. The Company has also \\nresponded to civil investigative demands from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the \"FTC\") in connection with the \\nFTC\\'s investigation related to money transfers and the Company\\'s anti-fraud program in its capacity as an agent. On June 28, \\n2022, the FTC filed a complaint against the Company in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that \\nWalmart violated the Federal Trade Commission Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule regarding its money transfer agent \\nservices and is requesting non-monetary relief and civil penalties. On August 29, 2022, the Company filed a motion to dismiss \\nthe complaint, on October 5, 2022, the FTC responded to the motion, and on October 28, 2022, the Company filed its reply. \\nThe court has entered an order staying discovery pending a decision on the Company\\'s motion to dismiss. The Company intends \\nto vigorously defend these matters. However, the Company can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcome of these \\nmatters and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise. Accordingly, the Company can provide no \\nassurance that its business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected.\\nNote 11.  Retirement-Related Benefits\\nThe Company offers a 401(k) plan for associates in the U.S. under which eligible associates can begin contributing to the plan \\nimmediately upon hire.  The Company also offers a 401(k) type plan for associates in Puerto Rico under which associates can \\nbegin to contribute generally after one year of employment.  Under these plans, after one year of employment, the Company \\nmatches 100% of participant contributions up to 6% of annual eligible earnings.  The matching contributions immediately vest \\nat 100% for each associate.  Participants can contribute up to 50% of their pre-tax earnings, but not more than the statutory \\nlimits.\\nAssociates in international countries who are not U.S. citizens are covered by various defined contribution post-employment \\nbenefit arrangements.  These plans are administered based upon the legislative and tax requirements in the countries in which \\nthey are established.\\nThe following table summarizes the contribution expense related to the Company\\'s defined contribution plans for fiscal 2023, \\n2022 and 2021:\\nFiscal Years En\\nded January 31,\\n(Amounts in millions) 2023 2022 2021\\nDefined contribution plans:\\nU.S. $ 1,491 $ 1,441 $ 1,290 \\nInternational  74  39  200 \\nTotal contribution expense for defined contribution plans $ 1,565 $ 1,480 $ 1,490 \\nAddi\\ntionally, the Company\\'s previously owned subsidiary in the United Kingdom sponsored a defined benefit pension plan.  In \\nfiscal 2020, Asda, Walmart and the Trustee of the Asda Group Pension Scheme (the \"Plan\") entered into an agreement pursuant \\nto which Asda made a cash contribution of $1.0 billion to the Plan (the \"Asda Pension Contribution\") which enabled the Plan to \\npurchase a bulk annuity insurance contract for the benefit of Plan participants, and released the Plan and Asda from any future \\nobligations.  In connection with the sale of Asda, all accumulated pension components of $2.3 billion were included in the \\ndisposal group and the estimated pre-tax loss recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 as discussed in Note 8  a\\nnd \\nNote 12 .  \\n77', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 78}), Document(page_content='Note\\n 12.  Disposals, Acquisitions and Related Items\\nThe following dispositions impact the Company\\'s Walmart International segment. Other immaterial transactions have also \\noccurred.  \\nAsda\\nIn February 2021,\\u2006the Company completed the divestiture of Asda, the Company\\'s retail operations in the U.K., for net \\nconsideration of $9.6 billion.  Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $0.2 billion \\nin other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes \\nin the net assets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon \\nclosing.  During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Asda and recognized \\nits retained investment in Asda as a debt security within other long-term assets and also recognized certain legal and tax \\nindemnity liabilities within deferred income taxes and other on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\\nAsda was classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2021, and as a result, the Company \\nrecognized an estimated pre-tax loss of $5.5 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the \\nfourth quarter of fiscal 2021.  Upon classifying the Asda disposal group as held for sale, $2.3 billion of accumulated pension \\ncomponents associated with the expected derecognition of the Asda pension plan were included as part of the loss.  In \\ncalculating the loss, the fair value of the disposal group was reduced by approximately $0.8 billion related to the estimated fair \\nvalue of certain indemnities and other transaction related costs.\\nSeiyu\\nIn March 2021, the Company completed the divestiture of Seiyu, the Company\\'s retail operations in Japan, for net consideration \\nof $1.2 billion.  Upon closing of the transaction, the Company recorded an incremental pre-tax loss of $0.2 billion in other gains \\nand losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the first quarter of fiscal 2022, primarily related to changes in the net \\nassets of the disposal group, currency exchange rate fluctuations and customary purchase price adjustments upon closing.  \\nDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company deconsolidated the financial statements of Seiyu and recognized its \\nretained 15 percent ownership interest in Seiyu as an equity investment within other long-term assets on the Consolidated \\nBalance Sheet.\\nSeiyu was classified as held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of January 31, 2021, and as a result, the Company \\nrecognized an estimated pre-tax loss of $1.9 billion in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income in the \\nfourth quarter of fiscal 2021. \\nWalmart Argentina\\nIn November 2020, the Company completed the sale of Walmart Argentina. As a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of \\n$1.0 billion in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 in other gains and losses in its Consolidated Statement of Income primarily due to \\nthe impact of cumulative translation losses on the carrying value of the disposal group.\\nNote 13.  Segments and Disaggregated Revenue\\nSegments\\nThe Company is engaged in the operation of retail and wholesale stores and clubs, as well as eCommerce websites, located \\nthroughout the U.S., Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico.  The Company previously operated in \\nArgentina prior to the sale of Walmart Argentina in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 and operated in the United Kingdom and \\nJapan prior to the sale of those operations in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.  Refer to Note 12 for di\\nscussion of recent \\ndivestitures.  The Company\\'s operations are conducted in three reportable segments: Walmart U.S., Walmart International and \\nSam\\'s Club.  The Company defines its segments as those operations whose results the chief operating decision maker \\n(\"CODM\") regularly reviews to analyze performance and allocate resources.  The Company sells similar individual products \\nand services in each of its segments.  It is impracticable to segregate and identify revenues for each of these individual products \\nand services.\\nThe Walmart U.S. segment includes the Company\\'s mass merchant concept in the U.S., as well as eCommerce, which includes \\nomni-channel initiatives and certain other business offerings such as advertising services through Walmart Connect.  The \\nWalmart International segment consists of the Company\\'s operations outside of the U.S., as well as eCommerce and omni-\\nchannel initiatives.  The Sam\\'s Club segment includes the warehouse membership clubs in the U.S., as well as eCommerce and \\nomni-channel initiatives.  Corporate and support consists of corporate overhead and other items not allocated to any of the \\nCompany\\'s segments.\\nThe Company measures the results of its segments using, among other measures, each segment\\'s net sales and operating \\nincome, which includes certain corporate overhead allocations.  From time to time, the Company revises the measurement of \\neach segment\\'s operating income, including any corporate overhead allocations, as determined by the information regularly \\n78', metadata={'source': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/data/walmart-inc-2023-annual-report.pdf', 'page': 79}), Document(page_content=\"re\\nviewed by its CODM.

CO\\nNTROLS AND PROCEDURES\\nEval\\nuation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\\nWe maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information, which is \\nrequired to be timely disclosed, is accumulated and communicated to management in a timely fashion.  In designing and \\nevaluating such controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and \\noperated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives.  Our management is necessarily \\nrequired to use judgment in evaluating controls and procedures.  Also, we have investments in unconsolidated entities.  Since \\nwe do not control or manage those entities, our controls and procedures with respect to those entities are substantially more \\nlimited than those we maintain with respect to our consolidated subsidiaries.\\nIn the ordinary course of business, we review our internal control over financial reporting and make changes to our systems and \\nprocesses to improve such controls and increase efficiency, while ensuring that we maintain an effective internal control \\nenvironment.  Changes may include such activities as implementing new, more efficient systems, updating existing systems, \\nautomating manual processes, standardizing controls globally, migrating certain processes to our shared services organizations \\nand increasing monitoring controls.  These changes have not materially affected, and are not reasonably likely to materially \\naffect, the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting.  However, they allow us to continue to enhance our internal \\ncontrol over financial reporting and ensure that our internal control environment remains effective.\\nAn evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the \\nperiod covered by this report was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including our \\nChief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.  Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief \\nFinancial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective to provide reasonable assurance that \\ninformation required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of \\n1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief \\nFinancial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and are effective to provide reasonable \\nassurance that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC\\'s \\nrules and forms.\\nReport on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nManagement has responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.  Internal \\ncontrol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial \\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles \\ngenerally accepted in the United States.  Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not \\nprevent or detect misstatements.  Management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company\\'s internal control over financial \\nreporting as of January 31, 2023.  In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of \\nSponsoring Organizations (\"COSO\") of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).  \\nManagement concluded that based on its assessment, Walmart\\'s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of \\nJanuary 31, 2023.  The Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, has been audited by Ernst & \\nYoung LLP as stated in their report which appears herein.\\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\\nThere has been no change in the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023, that has materially \\naffected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company\\'s internal control over financial reporting.\\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we will begin upgrading our financial system, including our general ledger and other \\napplications, in stages. This financial system will continue to be a significant component of our internal control over financial \\nreporting as it is implemented. \\nITEM 9B.OT\\nHER INFORMATION\\nNone\\n.\\nITEM 9C.
